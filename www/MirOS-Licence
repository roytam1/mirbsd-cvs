(The licence template ends here, only read below for further information,
 and how to integrate an advertising clause, if you have to and want to.)

 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * To apply the template[1] specify the years of copyright (separated
 * by comma, not as range), the legal names of the copyright holders,
 * and the real names of the authors if different. Avoid adding text.
 *
 * OPTIONAL ADVERTISING CLAUSE:
 * Adding advertising clauses is not recommended because they accumu-
 * late (MirOS #9 has a list of 130 required acknowledgements, out of
 * which several were duplicates with only minor changes) but if this
 * kind of crediting is desired, insert between the two paragraphs a-
 * bove the evaluation result of the following mksh(1)-style (grouped
 * by parentheses, separated by bars, can be omitted if prefixed by a
 * question mark) expression:
 *
 * (All a|A)dvertising materials mentioning features or use of this (
 * software|work) must display the following acknowledgement:
 *	This product includes (material|software) (provided by|devel-
 *	oped (at|?(or owned )by|under|for?( use (in|with)))) $name?(,
 *	)?( and (its|their|by other) contributors)?( (for|by) $name).
 *
 * RATIONALE:
 * This licence is apt for any kind of work (such as source code, do-
 * cumentation, fonts, graphics, sound, etc.) and the preferred terms
 * for works added to MirOS. It has been drafted as universally usab-
 * le equivalent of the "historic permission notice"[2] adapted to EU

(but there is no implied choice of law; MirOS itself uses extra
 provisions to do that, these will however hinder compatibility
 with other licences and certification compliance, and restrict)

 * law, because in some (droit d'auteur) countries one can't disclaim
 * all liabilities. Compliance to OSD[3] 1.9 and DFSG[4] 1.1 is safe,
 * and GPLv2 compatibility is asserted unless advertising clauses are
 * used or other (restrictive) text is added.
 *
 * We believe you are not liable for code inserted which is intellec-
 * tual property of third parties, if you were not aware of the fact,
 * act appropriately as soon as you become aware of this problem, and
 * seek an amicable solution for all parties.
