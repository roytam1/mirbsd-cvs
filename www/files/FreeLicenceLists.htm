 <title>List of lists of Free licences</title>

<p>Hi!<br />You’ve likely been pointed here for one of those reasons:</p><ol>
 <li>Discussion over Terms of Service for (code) hosting platforms.
  In this case you can just <a href="#lists">skip</a> to the lists.</li>
 <li>I requested you to publish some work under “CC0, sublicenseable under
  any <a href="http://www.mirbsd.org/FreeLicenceLists.htm">Free Licence</a>”.
  In this case, read on.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem with Public Domain is that my country doesn’t permit
 owners of copyright (and related rights) to fully relinquish their
 rights (and duties) related to a work, i.e. put them voluntarily into
 the Public Domain (to protect creatives from being exploited), but
 if you allow me (and others) to sublicense, you issue an explicit
 licence (just take it, I waive everything, use any Free licence from
 the lists below) that I (and others) can use. (Note: someone once
 tried to assign ownership of a work to me, which, unfortunately,
 similarily is not possible under the law I’m in. Just agree to the
 very liberal licence, which means you can still assign to PD when
 possible while giving us a fallback licence choice.)</p>
<p>The ideal text to use is:</p>
<p><tt>I, <i>name</i>, hereby publish this work under <a
 href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>
 and additionally permit recipients of the fallback licence (CC0 §3)
 to sublicense any copyright, patent and neighbouring rights necessary
 for dealing with the work under any licence appearing in one of the
 lists in <a href="http://www.mirbsd.org/FreeLicenceLists.htm">the
 list of lists of Free licences</a>.</tt></p>
<h1 id="lists">Free Licence lists</h1>
<p>The following links refer to lists of Free licences according to
 various standards (such as the Open Source Definition, the Copyfree
 Standard, the Open Knowledge Definition, the FSF’s, etc.) at various
 bodies’ websites.</p>
<p>Note: this list is intended to only include Free licences conforming
 to commonly accepted standards of Freedom (Free Software, Open Source,
 Free Cultural Works, Copyfree); the linked-to lists contain examples
 of non-conforming licences (e.g. “Licenses that are DFSG-incompatible”,
 “Non-Conformant Licenses”, “Nonfree Software Licenses”, “Nonfree
 Documentation Licenses”, Creative Commons -NC and -ND modules) which
 are <em>explicitly <strong>not</strong></em> included!</p>

<p>Note that, while this list is subject to change, and the contents of
 the linked lists is subject to change, I promise to only add lists of
 licences according to the generally accepted principles of Freeness
 (OSI, DFSG, FSF for code and OKFN for non-code and Copyfree generally).</p>
