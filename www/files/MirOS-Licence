INSTRUCTIONS:
To apply the template[1] specify the years of copyright (separated by
comma, not as a range), the legal names of the copyright holders, and
the real names of the authors if different. Avoid adding text.

OPTIONAL ADVERTISING CLAUSE:
Adding advertising clauses is not recommended because they accumulate
(MirOS #9 had 130 required acknowledgements, out of which several are
duplicates with only minor changes), but if this kind of crediting is
desired, the following mksh(1)-style (grouped by parentheses, separa-
ted by bars, parts can be omitted if prefixed by a question mark) ex-
pression provides a paragraph to be inserted between the two above:

 * (All a|A)dvertising materials mentioning features or use of this (
 * software|work) must display the following acknowledgement:
 *	This product includes (material|software) (provided by|devel-
 *	oped (at|?(or owned )by|under|for?( use (in|with)))) $name?(,
 *	)?( and (its|their|by other) contributors)?( (for|by) $name).

RATIONALE:
This licence is apt for any kind of work (such as source code, fonts,
documentation, graphics, sound etc.) and the preferred terms for work
added to MirBSD. It has been drafted as universally usable equivalent
of the "historic permission notice"[2] adapted to Europen law because
in some (droit d'auteur) countries authors cannot disclaim all liabi-
lities. Compliance to OSD[3] 1.9 and DFSG[4] 1.1 is ensured and GPLv2
compatibility is asserted unless advertising clauses are used.

(but there is no implied choice of law; MirOS itself uses extra
 provisions to do that, these will however hinder compatibility
 with other licences and certification compliance, and restrict)


We believe you are not liable for code inserted which is intellectual
property of third parties, if you were not aware of the fact, act ap-
propriately as soon as you become aware of a problem and seek an ami-
cable solution for all parties.

 various persons. As such it is protected by droit d'auteur. As long

 it can be used under the terms of this licence itself, e.g. for in-
