Terms and Conditions - The MirBSD Korn Shell
============================================

The MirBSD Korn Shell (mksh) consists of a number of "source" files,
which are provided by upstream in a number of places. This file will
list the files belonging to mksh or being part of it and the licence
terms and conditions that apply to them, in one single central place
for packagers' convenience. This list aims to be authoritative. (Yet
as it was compiled by a human, there may be bugs, please report them
if any are found. We don't think so though.)

All paths are relative to The MirOS Project's CVS repository.


The following files form The MirBSD Korn Shell R39b:
- build system, testsuite
  * mksh/Build.sh
  * mksh/check.pl
  * mksh/check.t
- documentation, configuration
  * mksh/dot.mkshrc
  * mksh/mksh.1
- source code
  * mksh/edit.c
  * mksh/emacsfn.h
  * mksh/eval.c
  * mksh/exec.c
  * mksh/expr.c
  * mksh/funcs.c
  * mksh/histrap.c
  * mksh/jobs.c
  * mksh/lalloc.c
  * mksh/lex.c
  * mksh/main.c
  * mksh/misc.c
  * mksh/sh.h
  * mksh/sh_flags.h
  * mksh/shf.c
  * mksh/syn.c
  * mksh/tree.c
  * mksh/var.c
  * mksh/var_spec.h
- upstream provided packaging
  * contrib/hosted/tg/deb/mksh/debian/** (Debian)
  * mksh/Makefile (MirBSD only, not part of mksh)
  * ports/shells/mksh/DEINSTALL
  * ports/shells/mksh/DESCR (official)
  * ports/shells/mksh/INSTALL
  * ports/shells/mksh/Makefile
  * ports/shells/mksh/PLIST
  * ports/shells/mksh/distinfo (official)
  * src/distrib/special/mksh/Makefile (for the MirBSD installer)
- website (informal)
  * www/data/tag_mksh.cfg (internal)
  * www/files/TaC-mksh.txt (this file)
  * www/pics/mksh.svg (logo source code)
  * www/pics/mksh128x100.png (logo compiled version)
  * www/src/mksh.hts (primary webpage)
  * www/src/mksh_bld.hts (supplemental webpage)
  * www/src/mksh_old.hts (supplemental webpage)

All of these files are covered by The MirOS Licence (Appendix A) ex-
cept the upstream provided packaging, some of which were copied from
other places (specifically some of the Debian packaging) and most of
which do not require a copyright licence.

The mksh author acknowledges the contribution from the Public Domain
Korn Shell and everyone who contributed to its various incarnations,
including patches, which have found their way into mksh (not all are
even known, but they gave up copyright anyway). The patches and sug-
gestions from other developers, users and other shells' authors were
also welcome.


The following files belong to mksh and are distributed inside of its
distfile, but are not part of it. They are provided for convenience,
because they are required on many operating environments for mksh or
some of its features to function:
- source code
  * mksh/setmode.c (needed for the optional mknod builtin)
  * mksh/strlcpy.c (always needed)

These files are covered by seperate licences in addition (Appendices
B and C). Some operating environments already provide their functio-
nality, such as the BSDs and OSX libc, or the Debian/freedesktop.org
libbsd package. The files are not compiled into the resulting binary
if their respective functionality is already provided.


The following files belong to mksh in a less close way, as they pro-
vide additional functionality less closely coupled or not always de-
sired. These are not included in the mksh distfile:
- source code
  * contrib/code/Snippets/arc4random.c (somewhat portable arc4random
    implementation on top of /dev/urandom - for $RANDOM reads)
  * contrib/hosted/tg/arc4rootdom.c (an even less portable implemen-
    tation of a4r_pushb for *WRT/Android/... - for $RANDOM writes)
  * contrib/hosted/tg/deb/klibc/arc4random.c (part of my klibc patch
    providing arc4random API on top of jrand48 for small size)
  * src/usr.bin/printf/printf.c (slightly modified UCB printf utili-
    ty code - for the optional, undesired printf(1) builtin)

The arc4rootdom.c file is covered by the MirOS Licence (Appendix A).
The klibc/arc4random.c file is also covered by The MirOS Licence but
dual-licenced with klibc's as we hope it gets included. The printf.c
file is covered by the UCB's three-clause BSD licence (Appendix B).

The arc4random.c file is a conglomerate of The MirOS Licence as well
as another but many people have touched this code so there are other
versions of it around with differing terms. See Appendix D for ours.


The MirOS Licence also applies as a collective-work copyright on The
MirBSD Korn Shell.

Note that these appendices may represent the terms and conditions of
more than one file, hence the actual wording of the files was folded
into one representation, with different copyright holders and years,
separated if merging was undesirable.
