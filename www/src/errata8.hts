 href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0058">CVE-2006-0058</a>).
 Sendmail versions older than 8.13.6 are vulnerable to a timing attack
 that allows the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The update contains an updated version of sendmail. After installing, you should recreate the databases by issuing the command:</p>

<blockquote><pre>cd /usr/share/sendmail/cf &amp;&amp; sudo make regen-databases</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can also install the updated configuration files in <tt>/etc</tt>.
 To do this, copy <tt>/usr/share/sendmail/cf/openbsd-proto.mc</tt> to
 <tt>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</tt>,
 <tt>/usr/share/sendmail/cf/openbsd-localhost.mc</tt> to
 <tt>/etc/mail/localhost.cf</tt>, and
 <tt>/usr/share/sendmail/cf/submit.mc</tt> to
 <tt>/etc/mail/submit.cf</tt>.</p>
