<h3>News <small><a href="#eof">bottom</a></small></h3>
<p><strong><tt>MirBSD #6 (LinuxTag)</tt> - Gasoline's not cheap</strong><br />
 The latest release will not be available to the general public - it's merely
 a snapshot only sold on a CD-R, with MirBSD on it, bootable, the source and
 ports tarballs, checksums and some packages - as well as a soundtrack.</p>
<p>08.07.2003<br /><strong>Major changes up to MirBSD #6-unlocked:</strong>
 The in-tree lynx has been updated to the last development snapshot, retaining
 most of the OpenBSD diffs and these from the old MirBSD <i>nlynx</i> port,
 adding new patches to increase the stability and functionality of lynx by a
 large amount. The inferior OpenBSD <tt>src/lib/csu/</tt> subsystem has been
 replaced by a new one, based upon the NetBSD csu subsystem - in fact, with as
 few changes as possible.
 Evilwm has been updated to 0.99.14, and functionality to resize windows was
 added. The documentation, even the man pages, have been extended to mirror
 this fact.
 The MirBSD licence has been rewritten after the <a
 href="http://www.ifross.de/">IFROSS institute</a> answering me, to make sure
 nobody using, distributing and coding MirBSD will be responsible for not
 intentionally done harm in Europe as well.
 A whole lot of minor changes and updates has been done as well, to improve
 both the stability and functionality of MirBSD even more than ever. Testing
 has been done to this release, too, although it was impossible - due to time
 constraints - to do as extensive testing as with the Release #5.</p>
<p>Informational note: links to the <a href="http://www.linuxtag.de/">LinuxTag
 2003</a> will be added <em>here</em> later - for example <a
 href="http://miros.mirbsd.org/tglaser/MirAbile/bookmark.php#lt2003bilder">pictures</a>.</p>
<p>09.07.2003<br /><strong>HEAD branch: </strong> Mop up and sync, remove
 any stuff removed in OpenBSD (except stuff I decided to not, such as
 jdk-1.1). Put anoncvssh into the base system source, since we don't yet
 mirror Their website; extend so it's easier configurable (not built by
 default due to customization).<br /><strong>MIRBSD_6 branch: </strong>
 Finish talks with musicians and artists about music; make Linuxtag ISOs
 and burn first CD with about 40 minutes of Soundtrack courtesy of <a
 href="http://www.aufgang.org/koch/homepage/music.asp">Karsten Koch</a>.
 Test the release and burn process, and its results.</p>
<p>14.07.2003<br />LinuxTag was a success, but not so much a financial one.
 Well, there's a bug in the OpenBSD part of the installer on the LinuxTag
 CD; you must not select or deselect packages, instead just type "done" when
 asked for packages. To post-install XFree86, use 'tar xphzvf xbase33.tgz'
 and similar.<br />Fix for ports/net/sirc: make UTF-8 support switchable off
 and on by /set, and off forever (so it doesn't even use Encode::) by -U.</p>
<p>15.07.2003<br />Enable DRI for XFree86 and use NO_CXX_INSTALLED in
 <tt>mk.conf</tt> and USE_CXX in ports makefiles.</p>
<p>19.07.2003<br />Catch-up: Synchronize base and ensure build. Try again to
 build DRI-enabled XFree86, fix NO_CXX_INSTALLED logic (can't do that in an
 Imakefile). <strong>Finally fix .Xmodmap</strong> so that switching to
 virtual consoles and between video modes works again. Remove libkrb5 in its
 entirety (this time, that means libcom_err and compile_et as well), same for
 old machine-dependant parts of libm (vax and friends). The SLIM kernel loses
 QUOTA and ISDN. More crap bites the dust (Windows&reg; code in Apache, more
 informational files (READMEs, ChangeLogs which don't apply here (we do have
 cvsweb)) and stuff removed in OpenBSD. Ensure PINE builds. Prepare to make
 a snapshot, test at the router box and upload. Change propolice URI.
 Update in-tree Apache to 1.3.28, retaining local changes. Oh, and DRI/DRM
 works. Sort of.</p>
<p><a href="http://miros.mirbsd.org/tglaser/MirAbile/bookmark.php#lt2003bilder">More PICS about LinuxTag</a></p>
<p>20.07.2003<br />Fix the installer bug, finally, d'oh.<br /><strong>It's
 true!</strong> - Import of gcc-3.3 into the base system. Removal of as much
 of the old fallback <tt>gcc 2.95</tt> as possible, including most of the old
 libiberty. Switch system to new libiberty. Fix tree build.</p>
<p>22.07.2003<br />Sync and start working to bring gcc-3.3 up to date.
 Currently only the old OpenBSD patches from ports/lang/egcs/stable/
 (gcc-3.2.3), etoh@'s propolice, and some of mine. Nothing MirBSD yet.</p>
<p>26.07.2003<br />gcc 3.3 still does not work. Update various things
 and prepare a snapshot. Development will slow down a bit; I have to
 reset-up my machines. Unbreak stuff.</p>
<p>27.07.2003<br />Really <a
 href="@@ABSPATH@@/MirOS/current/">upload a snapshot</a>
 for good now. Make back-ups and re-set-up system locally.</p>
<p>Unbreak, stabilize, slightly upgrade and update; renew stuff. Freshen up.
 Get the summer breeze ;-)<br />
 Get <tt>/etc/changelist.local</tt>, <tt>/etc/profile.local</tt> and
 <tt>/etc/mk.conf.local</tt> - suggest more. Change CVS temporary directory
 to <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. Fixes to pine (myself) and pico (from tedu@openbsd).</p>
<p>17.08.2003<br />Synchronize with OpenBSD. Remove the -h flag to ls(1).
 Revert a bunch of other commits that remove useful stuff or add bloat.
 Try to add a read-only feature to vnd(4). Import gcc-3.3.1 and sync
 config. Don't try to build this, kids...</p>
<p>18.08.2003<br />Build base system through, update ports. Port over
 NetBSD <tt>pkgsrc/net/p5-Socket6</tt> and switch sirc to require it
 (IPv6 mode only - though it still chats on IPv4). Improve its UTF-8
 capability. Misc. updates. Try to stabilize things. Add script to run
 lynx in unicode mode, xterm, closes parent xterm.</p>
<p>19.08.2003<br />Having recovered from all these social events (FOSDEM,
 CeBIT, LinuxTag, the now-weekly Netzladen.org meetings), I've finally
 managed to "fix" nroff (for quite low values of fix, though). If anybody
 wants to jump in to port the remaining stuff (rename eqn to neqn and fix
 stuff (Makefiles), import eqn/troff, import other stuff groff has but we
 don't, really fix it - KNF anybody? *g*), please send me unified diffs.
 The same goes for gcc-3.3.1 and winex-cvs.<br />
 Additional testing is needed for the entire ports tree: does it build
 under MirBSD? do packages actually work? does it build under GNU/Linux?
 Please report packages failing due to a non-existant C++ compiler, so
 they can be marked.</p>
<p>22.08.2003<br />Updated system. Fixed the shmget(2) bug from OpenBSD
 Errata. Ensured build; will upload snapshots soonish. Some minor fixes.
 Add Schnitzelmitkartoffelsalat.</p>
<p>post-22.08.2003<br />My main development machine, an Athlon laptop,
 eventually died. Well, I can still use it with an external 14" CRT,
 built around 1994, attached to it, but as soon as I move it, it loses
 power. It will need service. - Joshua Steele, MirBSD CVS and website
 hoster at <a href="http://www.bsdadvocacy.org/">BSD Advocacy</a>, gave
 his O.K. to host the ongoing MirLinux project (to be started in a few
 years :) within the MirBSD source tree. <small>Message-ID:
 &lt;20030822134010.486a7069.selerius@codefusion.org&gt;</small></p>
<p>30.08.2003<br />Back from holidays in/near Luxembourg. Adjust some
 Apache things (OpenBSD vs MirBSD). Synchronize Source, Ports and XF4
 with OpenBSD 3.4-beta. Clean up the ports tree: nuke nlynx, WWW in
 DESCR files. Merge OpenBSD stuff.</p>
<p>31.08.2003<br />Move from <tt>~/.bin</tt> to <tt>~/.etc/bin</tt>.
 Pull these directories into mtree. Finish merging of OpenBSD; fix
 a bunch of things while here. Move to <tt>~/.etc/lynxrc</tt>.
 While here, nuke old gcc-3.2/3.3 port of MirBSD version 2-3.</p>
<p>01.09.2003<br />More moves: .sircrc .sircrc.pl .sirc/ .ssh/
 .systrace/ .mc/ - move /usr/local/bin/dsirc to dsircp to avoid conflict.
 More struct ufs1_dinode (tree compile fixes). Apache 1.3.28 suexec fix
 from OpenBSD. <tt>MACHINE_OS</tt> and <tt>_MACHINE_OS</tt> in
 &lt;sys/param.h&gt; to start working on the MirLinux framework before
 the next MirBSD stable release (to achieve better code compatibility).
 Patch make(1) and the files in <tt>src/share/mk/</tt> accordingly.
 Same for the ports tree: ONLY_FOR_OS and NOT_FOR_OS, as well as the
 <i>make describe</i> facility. Nuke freenet6 port (out of date) and
 sprinkle <tt>@extra</tt> in djbdns. Build stuff and fix gcc.
 Stuff anoncvs framework including anoncvssh into base system.
 Update growfs from FreeBSD-current and ISDN from NetBSD-current.
 Synchronize packaging lists and prepare snapshot upload.</p>
<p>02.09.2003<br />Various Makefile fixes. Fix and build XFree86.
 Cleanup before making a snapshot (versions, root.mail, etc).
 mtree updates. Homepage updates. ports/INDEX sync. Nicefy make b-r
 in src. Provide MAKECONF_OVERRIDE for cross-compiling etc.
 Fix checkflists. Upload snapshot (complete). Update PLIP from
 inofficial NetBSD (mailing list) code.</p>
<p>03.09.2003<br />Work in MirPorts to denote it's not the OpenBSD
 ports tree (any more), and one must not bother the poor OpenBSD
 people for faults in MirPorts and/or the run-time environment (namely
 MirBSD, and - in the future - MirLinux). Nuke gcc-3.3.1, it's proven
 not ready for prime-time yet. Move gcc-3.3.1's libiberty out of the
 gcc/egcs tree into its own directory hierarchy under <tt>gnu/lib/</tt>
 and fulfil the OpenBSD peoples' plan of ${GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR} by moving
 files common to the GNU programmes to <tt>gnu/egcs/</tt>, including a
 file from <tt>usr.bin/less/</tt>. Fix the programmes accordingly, and
 have a major tree cleanup under <tt>gnu/</tt>. Play with GNU autoconf;
 pull in back the old autoconf-2.13 port as version &quot;2.13-o&quot;
 and fix the conflicts with 2.13-n as well as fix a mergo in 2.13-n.
 Expand the GFDL blurb, and note that there hasn't been any success in
 testing plip(4) yet. Move several programmes from the <tt>gnu/</tt>
 hierarchy out of the &quot;base&quot; set (base34.tgz) to the &quot;misc&quot;
 set (misc34.tgz), as well as clean the sets up (movement from/to base,
 comp and man - correcting the sets according to the docs).<br />
 Minor fixes on the make framework - <tt>make b-r</tt> and <tt>make
 contrelease</tt> (analog to <tt>make contbuild</tt>), as well as some
 improvements w.r.t. sudo(8)). Move on to <tt>MirBSD #7 (prerelease)</tt>
 and publish <a href="@@ABSPATH@@/plan.php">a
 development plan</a>.</p>
<p>04.09.2003<br />Licence audit (wrt the AT&amp;T/UNIX&reg;32V ./. Caldera
 stuff), <tt>mk.conf</tt> improvements for the egcc port. Updates for
 the acronyme database from NetBSD. <tt>~/.etc</tt> for the dillo
 browser and src/share/misc/contrib/dot.* (haven't used X in a while).
 Statically link gzip/compress - you'll be glad for <strong>that</strong>
 in the future. Change mdoc/man from MirBSD to MirOS where it makes sense.
 And a whole bunch of licence cleanup.<br /><strong>One Year MirBSD</strong>,
 and six days now. <a href="http://marc.info/?m=103065556502499">It
 all started with this reply</a>, when I decided to have my own, patched,
 <tt>/usr/src</tt>. That was on 29 August 2002, when Theo de Raadt, founder
 and chief benevolent dictator of OpenBSD, rejected my port of the useful
 wtf(1) utility from NetBSD wtf(6) to OpenBSD.</p>
<p>05.09.2003<br />Verify that <tt>ports/lang/egcs/stable</tt> builds,
 update some SSL Root CA Certs. Update cvsweb on the BSDadvocacy page
 and fix it in-tree. Put egcc/eg++ framework into /etc/mk.conf and
 test that<br /><tt>tg@odem:/usr/ports/net/centericq $ sudo make
 install clean MKC_EGCC=yes</tt><br />builds. Fix stupid manpage st(4)
 <tt>.Nm</tt> is parsed error (well, kludge). Save xdm configuration files
 in changelist. Add Art to /usr/share/man/COPYRIGHT, with copyright notice
 of the BSD d&aelig;mon. Curse. About. Gcc.</p>
<p>07.09.2003<br />Before having to give the laptop away, sync the update
 script with the updated OpenBSD one and upload another snapshot. Try to
 again fix egcc... <strong>and run centericq for the first time since 8
 (yes, eight) months again!</strong> And set up DNS.</p>
<p>09.09.2003<br />Attempt to improve the website (including my personal
 homepage) with not too much effort. No, I don't have got a stylesheet
 yet. Also, the DNS and IPv6 problems (issue: I don't have them) aren't
 resolved yet, although I have got an account at SixXS.net now.<br />
 Update: the subdomain <strong>mirbsd.org.</strong> has been delegated
 to me by <a href="mailto:kupfer@42h.de">the friendly owner of 42h.de</a>.
 Many thanks. The SSH key realms &amp;c. have been updated too, as the
 change is intended to be persistent. And make a new freenet6 port.</p>
<p>10.09.2003<br />Since freenet6 can be (temporarily) used with domain,
 IPv6, subnets and everything, until SixXS gets their system running, add
 the IP addresses of my hosts to the known_hosts database in the upstream
 file. Sort the shells file. Enable quotas on the development box.
 And some other stuff (account for bsiegert, in the hope he will do ports.
 browse the logs, congrats to Silveregg Co. Japan, who install MirBSD
 fairly often I think; patch adduser to match /etc/shells behaviour).
 Bump pine port to 4.58 (security fixes), since OpenBSD has locked.<br />
 bsiegert@ has fixed exim to compile, and a security fix will be imported
 with the next synchronization to OpenBSD for said port. He's got commit
 access to the ports tree. I've changed the mail address for ports again.</p>
<p>11.09.2003<br />Fix some very annoying and outstanding bugs in the new
 djbdns port. <strong>Upgrade strongly recommended!</strong>. Fix the good
 ole <tt>tmac.an.old</tt> once more. Benny Siegert goes mad on the ports
 tree, after figuring out how to use the MKC_EGCC variable. I've sorted out
 the (latest) ISDN patch [this was a hyperlink, but I removed the diff because OpenBSD sucks] from MirBSD to
 diff against OpenBSD 3.3-stable, for Waldemar Brodkorb.</p>
<p>12.09.2003<br />Late Night Netzladen meeting: exercise installing MirBSD
 manually on a notebook without floppy and CD (using sector editors etc.)</p>
<p>13.09.2003<br />Mop up and fix bugs in the homepage. Don't mirror files
 that are in the base install any more. Add a MirOS Certification Authority,
 because domains changed. So we can offer HTTPS again. Polish the boot code;
 should work on more broken BIOS boxen now, as well as the Soekris. (CHS
 single-sector-per-call mode, maybe necessary for the CD-ROM case in a bunch
 of boxen, too.) Add command &quot;machine oldbios&quot; to /boot.</p>
<p>14.09.2003<br />Validate the new boot code and nuke a few more of the
 dreaded NLS and LOCALE support code. And I finally found a good mentally
 impairedly looking penguin art with acceptable licence to include it.</p>
<p>15.09.2003<br />Got my athlon laptop back, but am ill.</p>
<p>16.09.2003<br />Update OpenSSH, X-Window. Sleep much, I'm still ill.</p>
<p>18.09.2003<br />Second sendmail update; ports tree sync with OpenBSD;
 fixes to some ports and the MirPorts makefile includes. /etc/services update
 from ViehBSE. Continued illness decreases. Update evilwm into a vendor branch
 and to latest release 0.99.16 from sourcefrog. Sync bootcode again... OpenBSD
 has updated theirs, apparently with code similar to ours. Play lynx.</p>
<p>19.09.2003<br />Wake up with headaches, start day slowly (by sleeping a
 lot). Later on, polish the freenet6 port. In late evening, merely fix boot
 code finally(!), and do ramdisks and testing in the NetzLaden. And verify
 X-Window builds; fix the XDrawArc manpage (by escaping pi).
 The kernel version generation code now includes the major/minor correctly
 and machine-parseable, as well as the default uname(1) output.</p>
<p>21.09.2003<br />Last boot code fixes before the <strong>release</strong>,
 some of the diffs feeded back up to OpenBSD (and committed). man page fix
 for djbdns (tinydns-data(8)). Build release with X and upload snapshot.
 New <a href="http://miros.mirbsd.org/tglaser/howto/mirwarum.txt">German essay</a> "why MirBSD?".</p>
<p>22.09.2003<br />Website work; font updates. Benny Siegert brings the
 ghostscript port up to date and de-braindeadifies it. Well, he tries.
 I've spent an hour fixing him up. And I did something which will be
 a surprise for the next release of MirBSD, scheduled RSN.<br />
 While you're reading here, <a href="http://patinfo.ffii.org/">please stop
 by at the EUROPEAN <strong>SOFTWARE PATENTS PROTEST</strong> page</a> and
 ask your MdEP (MEP) to vote for software freedom, because else, MirBSD and
 MirLinux, and especially MirPorts, will have great problems to not cease
 existing. For example, the <strong>progress bar <tt>ftp(1)</tt> currently
 displays is PATENTED</strong>, and much more.</p>
<p>23.09.2003<br />Seemingly last day before <strong>software patents
 decision</strong> is about to be made. Keep tuned.<br />
 In the meanwhile, I'm busier than my few sleep allows me (I'm barely able
 to go to workschool in the morning): Note that the "new" autoconf-2.13
 port is deemed stable enough, and correct its homepage... Fix up my sample
 .Xresources according to Tom Dickeys information, and have it meet the
 updated font artwork at my personal homepage (where there are some nice new
 pictures in ports/graphics/sng format). Nuke libgcj port finally, it was
 obsolete for years. Clean up the tree a bit (regression, notes, GNU ./. MirBSD,
 allow msdos encoding in xterm). Update centericq port to 4.9.6, latest release;
 remark that MSN might be broken. Update libiberty from the GNU binutils 2.14
 sources. Apply &quot;anti-verisign&quot; patches to djbdns, bump pkglevel.
 Several hours later, update binutils from 2.11.2 (in-tree), 2.13.2.1 (stable
 port), 2.12 (devel port) to 2.14 (in-tree), broken ports. Fix DJBDNS' original
 flavour and other stuff which could not have worked. Delete the remaining
 binutils regression test suites, as I don't have the time to cvs undelete _all_
 of them yet (someone beat me for deleting them in the first time, I coulda need
 them now, kinda). - I ought to get some sleep now.</p>
<p>24.09.2003<br />Seems as if this patent thingy ends in me being able to
 release MirBSD #7 - though I need more time than planned. In the meantime,
 stress-test new binutils (rebuild base and kernel) which succeeds. Fix
 some prototypes; ssh-keygen for RSA v1 keys. Benny imported cups and
 cups-pstoraster. I pull in glib2/gtk+2 updates from OpenBSD ports, and
 suggest to build as root whenever the "make configure" stage ends with
 "Killed." (why?). But: the crossover office port at least shines through
 (although the syscalls need to be emulated), and the ReWind (Wine) port
 builds fine, plus I learn much about our make with it. All ports get a
 new "cleandir" target. NASM gets updated, as well as redhat-base 8.0p3.
 Benny goes mad on ports that miss USE_CXX or LIBS+=-liconv. And finally
 I sync ISDN with NetBSD again (bugfix). Btw: regression tests can suck.</p>
<p>25.09.2003<br />Sync with OpenBSD base, write release announcement;
 finish testing of the ReWind port (disillusioning).</p>
<p>27.09.2003<br />CVS is playing games with me, and it's slow. It sucks.
 Well, there is no alternative unless you have 8 GB or more RAM (in which
 case OpenCM comes to mind). - Update Lynx to 2.8.5dev.16c which has many
 of our former local changes and those from OpenBSD merged in. Sync base
 again (which was where I have had problems). Nuke GNU bc/dc, use the UNIX
 ones (same done in OpenBSD now). Benny Siegert has fixed palm tools; I've
 updated mplayer and centericq. Also add sensorsd to the list of tools to
 build. Try to convert ISDN from select to poll because OpenBSD changed all
 of theirs (XXX someone please test!). Switch djbdns to ip6.arpa using the
 ip6.int mechanism of nibble-oriented backtracing. Install a snake-oil SMTP
 STARTTLS certificate, so sendmail uses it by default (ok johl@ccc-koeln).
 Synchronize all of base and X with OpenBSD, regenerate generated stuff.
 Install USD doc for bc and dc. Start importing all USD, PSD and SMM doc
 from 4.4BSD-Alpha which is yet missing. Put the Caldera licence on these
 where needed. Add eqn(1) man page for our neqn which is installed as eqn.
 Fix a bunch of tmac year displays. Enable "paper.txt" target for bsd.doc.mk
 in addition to "paper.ps" and make it default since the latter needs groff.
 Nuke GNU GNATS sendbug. Warn if egcs is not built using egcc. Pull in more
 than a huge bunch of 4.4BSD documentation and fix the ones we already have
 in tree, as well as their Makefiles. Someone to port soelim, etc. and fix
 refer is <strong>needed</strong>! The papers are installed now as well.
 The BOSng website starts being hosted at the MirBSD websites. And I start
 actually reading troff man and tutorial. It looks easier than before...
 During the release process, fixing X-Window fixes some ports. Yay.</p>
<p>28.09.2003<br />Finish importing OpenBSD work into MirOS BSD/MirPorts.
 Clean up and polish the base system; regenerate MirPorts index. Make the
 full base system build and install cleanly; fix packaging lists. Enter
 MirOS #7 RELEASE. Start building the formal release. <strong>The story
 ends here.</strong> You can now purchase (from Thorsten Glaser or
 SourceMill) a MirBSD Server OS set-up, or download the formal release
 of MirOS BSD #7, including a full base system set, the GNU Compiler
 Collection 3.2.3 and the JOE Editor 2.8 (as packages) as well as
