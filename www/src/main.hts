<h1>Welcome to the MirOS Project!</h1>

<h2>What is MirOS?</h2>

<p>MirOS BSD is a secure operating system from the BSD family for 32-bit
 i386 and sparc systems. It is based on 4.4BSD-Lite (mostly OpenBSD, some
 NetBSDÂ®). The <a href="/?ports">MirPorts Framework</a> is a portable ports
 tree to facilitate the installation of additional software. The project
 also releases some portable software: mksh, a pdksh-based shell;
 PaxMirabilis, an archiver for various formats; MirMake, a framework for
 building software; MirNroff, an AT&amp;T nroff based man page (and text
 document) formatter; MirCksum, a flexible checksumming and hash generation
 tool; and some more.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about these programs, visit the <a
 href="/?about">About MirOS</a> page.</p>
