<p class="rcsid">MirOS BSD &amp; MirPorts Framework – a wonderful
 operating system for a world of peace</p>

<h2>What is MirOS?</h2>

<p>MirOS BSD is a secure operating system from the BSD family for 32-bit
 i386 and sparc systems. It is based on 4.4BSD-Lite (mostly OpenBSD, some
 NetBSD®). The <a href="ports.htm">MirPorts Framework</a> is a
 portable ports
 tree to facilitate the installation of additional software. The project
 also releases some portable software: mksh, a pdksh-based shell;
 PaxMirabilis, an archiver for various formats; MirMake, a framework for
 building software; MirNroff, an AT&amp;T nroff based man page (and text
 document) formatter; MirCksum, a flexible checksumming and hash generation
 tool; and some more.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about these programs, visit the <a
