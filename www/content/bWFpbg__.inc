<h1>MirBSD &nbsp; MirLinux &nbsp; MirPorts &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; Main Page</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the MirOS Project!</h2>
<p>This project is driven by a small number of people, that's why this
 website isn't always up to date. It's optimised for lynx and works well in
 Konqueror; IE and Mozilla&trade;-crap have certain problems with it.</p>
<p><big>Where to go next?</big><br />If you want to read about what MirOS
 actually <b>is</b>, visit the &quot;about&quot; href (hyperlink) on the
 left side. &quot;Download&quot; should be self-explanatory, and files
 are available as well as a full ISO image!</p>
<p><big>We're looking</big> for people wanting to ensure quality of MirPorts
 under MirOS BSD, OpenBSD, Mac OSX Panther and Tiger, and Microsoft Services
 for Unix (aka Interix). If you're interested and have &gt;1
 year of experience with the OpenBSD Ports Tree, and are not scared of
 &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;; please contact us. We also <big>need web site
 hackers</big> who keep track of source changes.</p>

<h3 style="color:red;">Latest Releases</h3>
<p>CURRENT: April 11th, 2006: #8-current snapshot available via our <a
 href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent</a> tracker (ISO 9660,
 combined Live- and Installation CD).</p>
<p>CURRENT: February 15th, 2006: #8-current snapshot available for <a
 href="/MirOS/current/i386-20060215/">download</a> via the usual mirrors.</p>
<p>PORTS: February 15th, 2006: We are in the progress of &quot;doing things
 the right way&quot; so a few more ports may be broken at the moment &ndash;
 we're undergoing effort to fix them and mark every port which is broken as
 ${BROKEN} so you don't waste effort trying to build it (this is however not
 completed yet, bulk builds take a while).<br />At the moment, you can
 install the <a href="/?ports">MirPorts Framework</a> as regular user (or as
 root user by means of sudo(8) as &quot;system ports tree&quot; on MirOS),
 but only MirOS #8, OpenBSD and Darwin/Mac OSX are supported; Interix support
 is not totally complete yet. <em>You must now use <tt>mmake</tt> as make(1)
 programme.</em> The existing documentation may be inaccurate in parts.</p>
<p>STABLE: December 24th, 2005: <a href="/?ann-8">MirOS #8</a> is
 available via our <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent
 tracker</a>. <small>There is also an <a
 href="/MirOS/v8/">HTTP(S)</a> download/netinstall option.</small></p>
