<h1>MirBSD &nbsp; MirLinux &nbsp; MirPorts &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; Main Page</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the MirOS Project!</h2>
<p>This project is driven by a small number of people, that's why this
 website isn't always up to date. It's optimised for lynx and works well in
 Konqueror; IE and Mozilla&trade;-crap have certain problems with it.</p>
<p><big>Where to go next?</big><br />If you want to read about what MirOS
 actually <b>is</b>, visit the &quot;about&quot; href (hyperlink) on the
 left side. &quot;Download&quot; should be self-explanatory, and files
 are available as well as a full ISO image!</p>
<p><big>We're looking</big> for people wanting to ensure quality of MirPorts
 under MirOS BSD, OpenBSD, Mac OSX Panther and Tiger, and Microsoft Services
 for Unix (aka Interix). If you're interested and have &gt;1
 year of experience with the OpenBSD Ports Tree, and are not scared of
 &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;; please contact us. We also <big>need web site
 hackers</big> who keep track of source changes.</p>

<p>CURRENT: January 13th, 2005: #8-current snapshot available for <a
 href="/MirOS/current/i386-20060113/">download</a> via the usual mirrors.</p>
<p>STABLE: December 24th, 2005: <a href="/?ann-8">MirOS #8</a> is
 available via our <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent
 tracker</a>. <small>There is also an <a
 href="/MirOS/v8/">HTTP(S)</a> download/netinstall option.</small></p>
<p>PORTS: December 22th, 2005: The great reorganisation has settled down; you
 can install the <a href="/?ports">MirPorts Framework</a> as regular user,
 all pre-requisites including a recent enough <tt>mksh</tt> are being taken
 care of automatically. This is for MirOS #8, OpenBSD and Darwin only at the
 moment; Interix support is not yet (but almost) complete. <em>You must now
 use <tt>mmake</tt> as make(1) programme.</em> The existing
 documentation is inaccurate, especially the (former) MirWiki.
 Package upgrades are now available, yet still experimental.</p>
<p>MERCHANDISING: There are still T-Shirts up for order. Contact <a
 href="mailto:tg@66h.42h.de">tg@</a> for purchase information. ONLY ONE
 WHITE "LinuxTag 2004" T-SHIRT LEFT, NO REPRINTS. BUY THIS RARITY!
