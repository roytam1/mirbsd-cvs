<h2>Welcome to the MirOS Project!</h2>
<p>This project is driven by a small number of people, that's why this
 website isn't always up to date. It's optimised for lynx and works well in
 Konqueror; IE and Mozilla&trade;-crap have certain problems with it.</p>
<p><big>Where to go next?</big><br />If you want to read about what MirOS
 actually <b>is</b>, visit the &quot;about&quot; href (hyperlink) on the
 left side. &quot;Download&quot; should be self-explanatory, and files
 are available as well as a full ISO image!</p>
<p><big>We're looking</big> for people wanting to ensure quality of MirPorts
 under MirOS BSD, OpenBSD, Mac OSX Panther and Tiger, and Microsoft Services
 for Unix (aka Interix). If you're interested and have &gt;1
 year of experience with the OpenBSD Ports Tree, and are not scared of
 &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;; please contact us. We also <big>need web site
 hackers</big> who keep track of source changes.</p>

<p>Please do <b>not</b> use any of the snapshots still available on our

 get a CD at the LinuxTag 2005, lucky you but don't update Ports yet.
 If not, you will have to wait for the next MirOS #8 snapshot.</p>
