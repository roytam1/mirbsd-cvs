<h2>Software Patent Issues</h2>
<p>The <tt>MirOS Project</tt> warns about the dangers of algorithm, data
 structure and business model patentability and jointly protests against
 the European Union trying to legalise them. But we have failed so far,
 and what happens next, nobody knows. We can only say for sure that the
 EU <em>as well</em> as every single country which joined the European
 Patent Convention, including Switzerland etc., is <strong>not</strong>
 a democracy. Our German developers are deeply ashamed that our executive
 leadership willingly ignores the mandate from the legislative to stop
 the new EU directive.</p>

<h2>Welcome to the MirOS Project!</h2>
<p>This project is driven by a small number of people, that's why this
 website isn't always up to date. It's optimised for lynx and works well in
 Konqueror; IE and Mozilla&trade;-crap have certain problems with it.</p>
<p><big>Where to go next?</big><br />If you want to read about what MirOS
 actually <b>is</b>, visit the &quot;about&quot; href (hyperlink) on the
 left side. &quot;Download&quot; should be self-explanatory, and files
 are available as well as a full ISO image!</p>
<p><big>We're looking</big> for people wanting to ensure quality of MirPorts
 under MirOS BSD, OpenBSD and Mac OSX. If you're interested and have &gt;1
 year of experience with the OpenBSD Ports Tree, and are not scared of
 &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;; please contact us. We also <big>need web site
 hackers</big> who keep track of source changes.</p>

 you get Ports and a special boot floppy for Strato dedicated servers.</p>
