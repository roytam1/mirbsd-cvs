<h2>Welcome to the MirOS Project!</h2>
<p>This project is driven by a small number of people, that's why this
 website isn't always up to date. It's optimised for lynx and works well in
 Konqueror; IE and Mozilla&trade;-crap have certain problems with it.</p>
<p><big>Where to go next?</big><br />If you want to read about what MirOS
 actually <b>is</b>, visit the &quot;about&quot; href (hyperlink) on the
 left side. &quot;Download&quot; should be self-explanatory, and files
 are available as well as a full ISO image!</p>
<p><big>We're looking</big> for people wanting to ensure quality of MirPorts
 under MirOS BSD, OpenBSD, Mac OSX Panther and Tiger, and Microsoft Services
 for Unix (aka Interix). If you're interested and have &gt;1
 year of experience with the OpenBSD Ports Tree, and are not scared of
 &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;; please contact us. We also <big>need web site
 hackers</big> who keep track of source changes.</p>

<h3 style="color:red;">Latest Releases</h3>
<p>Please do <b>not</b> use any of the snapshots still available on our
 servers; they are very outdated and broken. If you had the chance to
 get a CD at the LinuxTag 2005, lucky you but don't update Ports yet.
 If not, you will have to wait for the next MirOS #8 snapshot.</p>
<!-- p>CURRENT: May 2nd, 2005: #8-gamma snapshot available via our <a
 href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent</a> tracker.</p>
<p>CURRENT: May 5th, 2005: #8-gamma snapshot available for <a
 href="/MirOS/current/i386-20050505/">download</a> via the usual mirrors.</p>
<p>STABLE: January 6th, 2005: <a href="/?ann-7">MirOS #7quinquies</a> is
 available for retrieval. Click the &quot;Download!&quot; link on the left
 for further information - where you can buy CDs or download the sets.</p -->
<p>PORTS: October 3rd, 2005: The great reorganisation has settled down; you
 now install the <a href="/?ports">MirPorts Framework</a> as regular user,
 all pre-requisites including a recent enough <tt>mksh</tt> are being taken
 care of automatically. This is for MirOS #8, OpenBSD and Darwin only at the
 moment; we will add Interix support (much?) later and MirOS #7 only on
 request; MirOS #7-current will probably remain unsupported. Also, there is
 no documentation at all for the new installer, and the MirWiki documentation
 is mostly inaccurate. The new installer is still considered experimental;
 don't expect imake ports to work, nor do perl ports work on Darwin.</p>
<p>MERCHANDISING: There are still T-Shirts up for order. Contact <a

<p><a href="/MirOS/CVS/cvsrepo-20050804.cgz">CVSREPO</a>: August 4th, 2005:
 seed file (153 MiB, <a href="/man1/gzsig.htm">gzsig</a>d) for reducing the
 initial transfer costs. We would like to offer CTM too; it is available on
 request but nobody uses it yet.</p>
<p><a href="/MirOS/CVS/cvsroot-20050316.cgz">CVSROOT</a>: March 16th, 2005:
 final and complete seed file (325 MB) for the historic old repository.</p>
