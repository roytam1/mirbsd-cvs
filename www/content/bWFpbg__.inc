<h2>Welcome to the MirOS Project!</h2>
<p>This project is driven by a small number of people, that's why this
 website isn't always up to date. It's optimised for lynx and works well in
 Konqueror; IE and Mozilla&trade;-crap have certain problems with it.</p>
<p><big>Where to go next?</big><br />If you want to read about what MirOS
 actually <b>is</b>, visit the &quot;about&quot; href (hyperlink) on the
 left side. &quot;Download&quot; should be self-explanatory, and files
 are available as well as a full ISO image!</p>
<p><big>We're looking</big> for people wanting to ensure quality of MirPorts
 under MirOS BSD, OpenBSD, Mac OSX Panther and Tiger, and Microsoft Services
 for Unix (aka Interix). If you're interested, please contact us. We also
 <big>need web site hackers</big> who keep track of source changes.</p>

 upgrade/unbreak the port or, better, contribute a patch yourself.</p>
