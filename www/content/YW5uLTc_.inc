<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>This release contains at least the following changes since MirOS #7quater:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Package tools removed.</b><br />
    To install the package tools and the other MirPorts stuff, check out
    the <tt>ports</tt> module from CVS and place all the files under
    <tt>/usr/ports</tt>. (If you only want to install binary packages, the
    top-level files and <tt>infrastructure/</tt> are enough.) After that,
    execute the command <tt>make setup</tt> to install the necessary files.
    </li>
  <li><b>Security fixes.</b><br />
    This release contains all errata until the end of December 2004. For an
    exact list, see the 
    <a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/SevenQuaterUpdates">MirWiki:SevenQuaterUpdates</a>
    page.</li>
  <li><b>Kernel and driver fixes.</b><br />
    All the non-security errata that have been applied to OpenBSD 3.4-stable
    are included, too. These are mostly kernel fixes and driver updates.</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>What is MirOS?</h2>

<p>MirOS BSD (or MirBSD) is a secure operating system derived from <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>. It incorporates code from
many other sources, particularly from <a
href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>. These systems share a common
origin - Berkeley UNIX (BSD), originally developed
at the University of Berkeley. MirOS #7quinquies is available for Intel-based
computers from 80486DX or 80487SX onwards. For the moment, SPARC users will have to use MirOS BSD #7quater.</p>

<p>The MirOS development team would like to say thanks to the Unix Research
Groups at AT&amp;T and Berkeley, the people involved in 4.4BSD, 386BSD, NetBSD&trade;
and the OpenBSD team, as well as the various people who have contributed code
and documentation (FreeBSD and ISDN4BSD, Sendmail, Apache&trade;, X Consortium,
the Free Software Foundation and the FSF Europe, to name a few).</p>

<p>We would also like to thank all those people who have supported MirOS
in the past, including sponsoring the developers and plain downloading
and using MirOS. Special thanks go to Josh "selerius" Steele from CodeFusion
IS for hosting the <tt>mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org</tt> website, as well as Andreas
"ScottyTM" Kupfer and Bastian "waldi" Blank for providing domain names for the
project.</p>

<h2>Major Differences to OpenBSD</h2>

<p>Selected changes of the MirOS #7 line against the current (end of
 2003) development version of OpenBSD include:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Improvements in the CVS infrastructure.</li>
<li>Slim base system: documentation and programmes that are considered
 not basic, or bloated, unnecessary or have a licence considered not free
 enough, have been removed or moved to the MirPorts framework to be
 installed later. Among these are: Kerberos IV, Kerberos V, NIS/YP, BIND 9,
 AFS/Arla, AMD, NLS/Locale/I18N; the C++, Fortran and Objective-C compilers
 of the GNU C Compiler suite 2.95.3 and everything that was licensed under
 the GNU Free Documentation License which declared front or back cover texts
 or invariant sections. Easy shortcuts have been added for people who want to
 rebuild their base system with SENDMAIL SASL or without sendmail, apache, the
 documentation, games, perl, ...</li>
<li>Several GNU utilities have been replaced by their BSD UNIX&reg;
 counterparts from AT&amp;T UNIX&reg; up to 32V, which was released by Caldera
 International, Inc. (now known as The SCO group) in 1999 under a four-clause
 UCB-style open source certified licence, in order to enable the customer to
 do with MirOS what he wants. Among these are: Groff, BC/DC, GZip, Diff.</li>
<li>Unused files (documentary, ChangeLogs, VMS and Win32 code) has been
 removed to speed up retrieving and updating the source tree.</li>

<li>Except for the compiler for the C Language, gcc 2.95 has been removed
 from the base system. The C compiler is installed as <tt>pgcc(1)</tt>
 fall-back compiler only, to prepare the move to the GNU Compiler Collection
 version 3 in the next MirOS release. - The entire base system has been made
 compilable using the fallback compiler only. No C++ code is left.</li>
<li>Since MirOS currently targets machines with an 80486DX CPU and more than
 32 MiB RAM only, and in the future will run on Pentium-class machines only.
 The sparc version has been tested on two SPARCstation 20.
 The XFree86 3.3.6 subsystem, the X11R5 and any non-i386 code have been
 removed from the tree as a consequence.</li>
<li>This eliminates potential bug sources in the base system and improves
 system stability as well as performance.</li>
<li>The Apache web server has been updated to the latest 1.3 release and
 comes with integrated support for the IPv6 Internet Protocol.</li>
<li>GNU libiberty has been updated to latest code from GCC 3.3.1 and GNU
 binutils 2.14. The GNU binutils used in-tree have been updated to 2.14.</li>
<li>The popular X11 Window Manager <tt>evilwm(1)</tt> has been updated to
 the latest version and enhanced. It is installed by default, although the
 OpenBSD <tt>fvwm(1)</tt> environment is still enabled bt default.</li>

<li>The licence for distributing the BSD d&aelig;mon and the Linux penguin
 has been obtained, so these pictures were not removed from XFree86.</li>
<li>The popular web browser <tt>lynx(1)</tt> has been updated to the latest
 development snapshot and fixed; some fixes and enhancements have been
 submitted upstream and even integrated.</li>
<li>All of the in-tree GNU software has common scripts such as a top-level
 master configure, install-sh, mkinstalldirs (from BSD) and friends moved to
 ${GNUSYSTEM_AUX_DIR} at a central place in the tree.</li>
<li>The i386 MBR (master boot record) and PBR (first-stage boot loader / partition
 boot record) code has been rewritten from scratch using the GNU assembler's
 new <tt>intel_syntax,noprefix</tt> mode. Thus it documents said mode now,
 because the GNU documentation is inaccurate and partially wrong.</li>
<li>The i386 boot code (MBR, PBR, /boot) has been extended by support for LBA and
 single-sector CHS access mode, thus supporting drives larger than 8 Gigabyte
 as well as Soekris systems and other computers with an old or broken BIOS.</li>

<li>The i386 MBR code has an optional (enabled by default) boot manager integrated
 which facilitates booting the default partition, a chosen primary partition
 on the first hard disc, or chaining to the first floppy drive. After a
 time-out of 10 seconds it boots the default partition.<br />The
 non-bootmanager MBR code can be installed by executing:<pre>

		# fdisk -ef /nonexistent wd0
		fdisk: 1&gt; u
		fdisk: 1&gt; w
		fdisk: 1&gt; q
 </pre></li>
<li>Network-bootable bsd.rd.net kernel for SPARC, eliminating the need for
 more than a RARP and TFTP d&aelig;mon on the source side.</li>
<li>Support for nearly everything the GENERIC kernel supports on the CD-ROM
 (bsd.rd) installation kernel to facilitate using it as a chroot(2) rescue
 and emergency system.</li>

<li>Installation support using FAT, ext2, ext3, UFS1 ffs, NTFS, HTTP, FTP,
 NFS as source medium. Support for PPP with kernel-mode pppd(8) on the 1440Ki
 floppy, and PPP with user-mode ppp(8) supporting ISDN SyncPPP and HDLC,
 PPP, PPPoE, PPPoA on the 2880Ki floppy/CD-ROM. Integrated support for setting
 up a RAID root system and installing to it.</li>
<li>Own set of boot floppies, kernel structured like GENERIC.</li>
<li>Support for disabling <tt>fsck(8)</tt> for ffs filesystems with softdep
 enabled (default in the MirOS installer) in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
 Includes automatic sorting of the fstab file implemented in korn shell.</li>
<li>Regular synchronization of the base system and MirPorts with OpenBSD.</li>
<li>Highly improved set of shell script infrastructure using security
 features of the Korn shell, which is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> in MirOS. Automatic
 discovery of IDE hard disc drives which need their write cache disabled.</li>

<li>Import of enhancements from NetBSD, FreeBSD and MicroBSD:</li>
<li>Improvements for the ELF executable format from NetBSD, leading to
 support for recent Wine (MS Windows&reg;) emulators.</li>
<li>Full ISDN BRI (64k*2) and PRI (T1-1536kbps and E1-2048kbps) support
 (no PRI/PMX device drivers yet) and isdnd(8) userland tool from NetBSD,
 but with unsafe string functions such as sprintf(3) removed and replaced
 by their safe counterparts (snprintf(3), strlcpy/strlcat(3)).</li>
<li>Privacy improvements: root can forbid "ps a" and "ps e" (show all users
 the processes of all users, or the environment attached to a process)</li>
<li>Allow mknod() to succeed within a chroot() unless disabled in the kernel
 configuration. This allows much cleaner release builds.</li>
<li>The <tt>CTM</tt> package, growfs(8) and ffsinfo(8), as well as some
 minor files from FreeBSD.</li>
<li>Improved wtf(1) originated from NetBSD wtf(6) with a huge acronyme
 database in two languages.</li>

<li>Always initialize variables in the kernel to 0 (from MicroBSD).</li>
<li>Integrated tinyirc and ssfe programmes (GNU) and dict (NPL) in the
 base system, facilitating easy support in the Freenode or OFTC IRC network.
 Replaced unsafe string functions in these with safe counterparts.</li>
<li><tt>host(1)</tt> including a nslookup fallback compatibility script
 from the audited (prior) OpenBSD BIND4 versions.</li>
<li>hd(1) as variant of hexdump(1) with MS-DOS-alike display.</li>
<li>Lynx SSL improvements; install a bunch of well-known X509v3 Root CA
 certificates for lynx and sendmail by default.</li>
<li>sendmail comes with STARTTLS up and running by default using a snake-oil
 certificate, suggested by Thorsten Glaser and discussed with members of the
 Chaos Computer Club and Trash.net. Read starttls(8) to find out more!</li>
<li>DRI support in the X-Window subsystem. No DRM yet, though.</li>
<li>Supplied sample files: <a href="http://www.ifross.de/">ifrOSS</a> approved
 licence template to be used for newly written code in MirOS. Sample X-Window
 environment and OpenSSL CA configuration files.</li>

<li>Much enhanced COPYRIGHT file, including a summary of all advertising
 clauses that have existed in the project tree. ASCII-Art of MirOS related
 pictures. Acknowledgement to use the BSD d&aelig;mon for the project from
 Marshall Kirk McKusick. Install GNU licenses by default, too.</li>
<li>Infrastructure for supporting more than one underlying kernel/libc
 (base OS) combination, which will eventually lead to MirLinux.</li>
<li>Manpage fixes and enhancements, date display fixed and unified between
 tmac.an.old and tmac.mdoc; Makefile enhancements (make foo.E generates a
 preprocessed source file); what is now MirOS/MirPorts and started as
 OpenBSD-current-mirabile is more than one year old! - Updated papers, USD,
 PSD and SMM documentation from 4.4BSD-Alpha under the Caldera license.</li>
<li>Configuration files change: A lot of &quot;dotfiles&quot; such as
 <tt>~/.ssh</tt> have been moved (for example to <tt>~/.etc/ssh</tt>).
 More &quot;local&quot; files are supported (for example /etc/mk.conf.local,
 /etc/profile.local, /etc/changelist.local). More files are installed and
 enabled by default (for example /etc/profile, ~/.etc/ssh/known_hosts,
 /etc/mk.conf). Porters are suggested to fix their ports to obey to the
 <tt>~/.etc/</tt> structure, too.</li>

<li>Ports tree (MirPorts subsystem) enhancements:</li>
<li>&quot;Plug-In&quot; support for <tt>gcc 3.2.3</tt> in /etc/mk.conf for
 compiling software using the MirPorts framework (but not for recompiling
 the base system; that's scheduled for the next MirOS release).</li>
<li>New or enhanced ports, for example: djbdns (IPv6, VeriSign, fixes);
 Wine/WineX/XoverOffice/ReWind; CUPS; Pine; sIRC; PGP 2.6.3in; RealPlayer;
 mPlayer; DJB daemontools; Midnight Commander; CenterICQ; p5-Socket6 (for
 IPv6 sockets in perl), JOE's Own Editor v2.8, the SixXS public beta IPv6
 tunnel heartbeat client, a <strong>working K Desktop Environment, version
 3.2.1</strong> and <strong>the GNU GNOME desktop suite and developer's
 framework, version 2.4</strong>.</li>
<li>Some ports removed from OpenBSD for political or broken-ness reasons
 have been resurrected: ucspi-tcp, sunjdk-1.1, flashplugin for example.</li>
<li>A whole lot of minor optimizations and cleanup</li>
<li>Support and development via IRC and Usenet, not through ancient ICB.</li>
<li>And no remote holes in the default maintainer in ONE year!</li>
</ul>

<p>MirOS #7 is only an interim release with pentium optimizations. Other
releases of MirOS use gcc 3.x as the default compiler, with Athlon
optimizations. MirOS/x86 runs on systems with Pentium-compatible CPU and
more than 32 Mebibytes of RAM.<br />Despite being an interim release,
MirOS #7quinquies is - contrary to MirOS #5 - designed to provide a stable,
commercially usable codebase and long-time usability.</p>

<p>In order to employ the full functionality of the installer, you
will have to edit files (<tt>ppp.conf</tt>, <tt>isp</tt>/<tt>isp.chat</tt>,
<tt>isdnd.rc</tt>, <tt>raid0.conf</tt> are examples) with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ed"><tt>ed(1)</tt></a>
editor. To ease that, this manual page is included in the installation image,
located as &quot;ed.hlp&quot; in the root directory on x86.
If you do not like the bootmanager facility, choose the <tt>(u)pdate</tt>
option in fdisk after starting it like <tt>fdisk -ef /nonexistent wd0</tt>.
If you like installing on a CCD device, add &quot;ccd0 on&quot; to
<tt>/var/run/dmesg.boot</tt> so the installer recognizes it. After creating
and enabling RAID devices, it's recommended to run &quot;raidctl -A yes
raid0&quot; (or -A root) and reboot, after which the installer should
automatically recognize it.</p>

<p>If you have support inquiries or other questions, please visit the IRC
 channel <tt>#deutsch</tt> on the OFTC network: <a
 href="http://www.oftc.net/">irc6.oftc.net</a> (or irc.oftc.net for all
 these people who only have IPv4 instead of full Internet access).<br />
 Earlier we have been in the Freenode PDPC (OPN) IRC network: <a
 href="http://freenode.net/">http://www.freenode.net/</a>.</p>

<p>From within MirOS, simply hit &quot;tinyirc&quot;, return, &quot;/join
 #deutsch&quot; and return; please notice that root users are banned from
 using IRC for security reasons.
 Another place considered a support channel for MirOS is the usenet; more
 specifically <tt>comp.unix.bsd.misc</tt> or <tt>de.comp.os.unix.bsd</tt>.<br />
The default shell is <tt>csh</tt> for historical reasons, but can be changed
to <tt>ksh</tt> - using tcsh or GNU bash is not officially supported.</p>

<p>If you like MirOS, feel free to support the developers with an amount
 of money within your choice. Please contact us by eMail if you wish to
 do so. We're using sponsored money mainly to improve MirOS, but also
 to build up a community of open source (BSD preferred) users in the local
 area of the head developer (Bonn, Germany) as well as via IRC. Finally, we
 support our upstream code feeders, mainly OpenBSD, but also others, with
 donations - which is why you should <strong>not</strong><b> directly donate
 to the OpenBSD project for MirOS any more</b>.</p>

This is the licencing information for the MirOS and MirPorts system
developed by the MirOS Project group in Europe as an OpenSource(TM)
operating system.
Note that the MirOS system is, due to the variety of licences used,
not OSI certified Open Source software, but we believe that all our
licences, for code, documentation and artwork, meet the Open Source
Definition as designed by the OSI (Open Source Initiative).


The MirOS Project licences their compilations under the following
terms and conditions:

 *
 * Licensor hereby provides this work "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY of

 * rect or other, however caused, arising in any way out of the usage
 * of covered work, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.
 *
 * Maximum effort feasible has been done to verify all work which has
 * been added to this compilation; to the maximum extent of our know-
 * ledge there is no malicious code or intellectual property of third
 * parties in MirOS which has not been properly licenced.  However we
 * cannot personally verify the identity of each author nor all lines
 * of text; thus, if something bad should happen, we would be pleased
 * to hear of it immediately so the work in question can instantly be
 * removed from the MirOS project.  We (the project) disclaim any li-
 * ability for any piece of work licenced by others into MirOS.
 *
 * This licence agreement shall be governed in all aspects by the law
 * of Germany; designated place of court is Bonn, NRW, Germany.  (Der
 * Gerichtsstand ist Bonn, NRW/Deutschland. Es gilt deutsches Recht.)

The individual works that are compiled into this collection are co-
vered by individual licence clauses. Most of these licences are re-
produced below; for an additional overview of separated, but inclu-
ded, third-party software, please refer to either of
 * /usr/share/legal/LICENCE
 * https://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:8890/cvs.cgi/src/share/doc/LICENCE
You are required to read, understand and accept the listed licences
before using the third-party software (such as Apache, Sendmail and
the GNU toolchain).

The MirPorts framework is a defined way to install third-party app-
lications under the MirOS system (in all its flavours such as MirOS
BSD and MirOS Linux), as well as other operating systems like Open-
BSD and ekkoBSD.
Thus, the MirPorts Framework Team consists of developers from MirOS
project, as well as independent contributors to the infrastructure,
and the people contributing their own ports. Many ports of MirPorts
are derived from the OpenBSD ports tree, which has been made freely
available without a special licence; the MirPorts Framework instead
is covered by a licence similar to the above - the individual ports
however remain freely available. The patch files provided with some
ports are usually unified diffs against third-party software, which
thus share their licence. If such a diff cannot be freely provided,
a forward ed(1) diff is to be included in MirPorts instead.

Several of the authors named below have since removed, or ceased to
enforce, the third (advertising) clause; for reference, we have not
removed the clause below though.
