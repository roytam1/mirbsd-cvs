<h1 id="top">MirOS #8</h1>

<p style="font-size:smaller; text-align:right; font-variant:small-caps;">All
 your build system are belong to us!</p>

<p>The MirOS Project is proud to announce the immediate release of MirOS XP,
 consisting of MirOS BSD #8 and the MirPorts Framework. This release is the
 first in the MIRBSD_8 branch and still highly experimental in some parts,
 especially ports, but has been throughoutly tested and deemed stable.</p>

<h2 id="yield">Yield</h2>

<p>The <tt>MirOS BSD #8semel</tt> release consists of the ninth edition
 of the MirOS BSD kernel and the MirOS userland, as well as a snapshot
 of the current MirPorts Framework. MirOS is delivered on an ISO9660
 release CD-ROM image which contains a bootable El Torito compliant file
 system in &quot;No Emulation&quot; mode including a ramdisk kernel,
 the release binaries, source code and HTML versions of all documentation
 in roff format. We also have packed a few contributed files, such as a
 selected number of distfiles for ports, on the CD.</p>

<p>MirOS as a whole comes under a BSD-style licence but contains much work
 under different licences. You can find an overview in the directory
 <tt>/usr/share/doc/legal/</tt>, especially in the file <tt>1stREAD</tt>.
 Most of the information regarding the base system is available as an <a
 href="https://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de:445/r8man/man7/BSD-Licence.htm">HTML
 document</a> online as well. The remaining documents can be found at <a
 href="https://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de:445/cvs.cgi/src/share/doc/legal/?only_with_tag=MIRBSD_8">the
 CVSweb</a> for the release as well prior to installation. The required
 advertising clauses are reprinted below as well. All trademarks belong
 to their respective owners, which are not listed here because they change
 often and we do not want to mis-represent them.</p>


<h2 id="reqm">Requirements</h2>

<p>MirOS #8semel runs on the i386 platform only. To use MirOS BSD on a
 sparc platform (32 bit), please download MirOS #7quater. You can use
 MirOS #8semel on the amd64 platform in 32-bit mode without any
 curtailing.</p>

<p>MirOS BSD #8/i386 requires at least an Intel Pentium or compatible
 processor, although formally an 80486DX or 80487SX will also work
 (a numeric coprocessor is required). We have not tested working with
 less than 32 MiB RAM. Installation requires much more memory than
 normal operation, but the GENERIC kernel takes up 10 MiB RAM plus a
 minimal buffer cache.</p>

<p>You need some kind of console, either a Hercules/MGA, MDA, CGA, EGA,
 VGA or compatible graphics card and PC/XT, PC/AT or IBM PS/2 keyboard,
 or a serial console.</p>

<p>To install MirOS, you need (as told above) lots of main memory, and
 some means of booting the ramdisk kernel and transferring the sets.
 This requires a bootable CD-ROM drive or a 3&frac12;" High Density
 floppy drive (for the <tt>floppy8.fs</tt> set) or network boot (e.g.
 via PXE).</p>

<p>A minimum installation of MirOS (kernel, BSD base system, configuration
 files and GNU base system) requires about 150 MiB hard disc space,
 although running without the development tools installed is discouraged;
 you need about 325 MiB then. Although the <tt>ports8.ngz</tt> set is
 very small it expands to about 80 MiB of hard disc space expanded on
 standard block size, more if your partition is very large (remember
 to plan in space for distfiles, packages and temporary compilation
 which can take several Gibibytes for ports like jdk, firesomething, and
 openoffice). The X-Window system requires about 111 MiB of additional
 hard disc space. Remember that these values depend on the block size
 used by the filesystem which may vary depending on its size; the
 values given are calculated quite conservatively.</p>


<h2 id="last">Last-minute information</h2>

<p>The release contains a <tt>pkgutl8.ngz</tt> set which is provided as
 a helper for people who do not wish to install ports by source, only
 binary packages, and do not need a compiler. It contains the results of
 running <tt>make setup</tt> in <tt>/usr/ports</tt> after a fresh
 installation.</p>

<p>We advise to <strong>not install</strong> this set if you want to use
 the MirPorts framework.</p>

<p>After the release we have fixed an omission in the MirPorts installer
 which prevented X-Window applications such as <tt>japanese/kterm</tt>
 from working properly because their app-defaults files were not found.
 Please upgrade <tt>/usr/ports</tt> (at least <tt>Makefile</tt> and the
 <tt>infrastructure</tt> directory) after installation, then execute
 <tt>make setup</tt> yourself.</p>

<p>Please remember that the MirPorts Framework is a moving target. When
 upgrading you should read the appropriate mailing lists to stay informed
 about possible backwards-not-so-compatible changes.</p>

<p>Secondly, the ld(1) linker should be updated by an erratum yet to be
 released to prevent a core dump in shared library dependencies.</p>


<h2 id="get">Getting MirOS</h2>

<p>We sell MirOS CDs on conferences and trade fairs, as well as via
 postal service. Please contact <a href="mailto:miros-dev@mirbsd.org">the
 developer list</a> for further information if you are interested.
 Customised release CDs are available on request.</p>

<p>The formal release ISO9660 filesystem image (without the bonus tracks)
 can be retrieved via <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">our
 BitTorrent tracker</a> (in some cases, the statistics may be out of
 date or not working at all, don't worry, just try whether it works).</p>

<p>You can also download the complete ISO from the public download mirrors.
 There is also an &quot;expanded view&quot; which enables you to only
 download specific files from the CD or do a network installation.</p>

<p>The location of the downloads is usually <tt><a
 href="https://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de:445/MirOS/ISOs/">/MirOS/ISOs/</a></tt>
 or <tt><a href="https://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de:445/MirOS/v8/">/MirOS/v8/</a>
 (equalling /MirOS/v8.1/ for the #8semel release)</tt>; the links here are
 adjusted to the main mirror.</p>


<h2 id="osinst">OS installation</h2>

<p>To install MirOS we suggest booting a ramdisk kernel (<tt>bsd.rd</tt>),
 either by booting from the ISO, or <tt>cdrom8.iso</tt> (the mini-ISO image
 provided), or using a standard MirOS (or OpenBSD) boot(8/i386) bootloader.
 The ramdisk kernel takes up about 10 MiB but can be compressed on disc
 using gzip(1).</p>

<p>If you cannot boot the ramdisk kernel consider taking the target hard disc
 into a machine which can. There is a floppy ramdisk kernel which has much
 lower requirements but also lacks device drivers and functionality, and has
 only undergone the most basic testing. We suggest to only use it to transfer
 a <tt>bsd.rd</tt> to the disc and make it bootable, then to continue the
 installation with the GENERIC ramdisk kernel.</p>

<p>Please read <a href="https://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de:445/r8man/man7/install.i386.htm">the
 extensive documentation</a> on the installation process for a walk-through.
 Further information might also be acquired by reading the documentation
 on <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">the OpenBSD website</a>.</p>


<h2 id="portsinst">Ports installation</h2>

<p>Please read the Setup.sh(8) manual page of the current MirPorts Framework
 for a complete documentation of the new installer.</p>

<p>The recommended, mostly backwards-compatible, way to install the porting
 system on MirOS #8 is to change to <tt>/usr/ports</tt> then execute <tt>make
 setup</tt> (SUDO=sudo is implied). In this case you do not even have to
 source SetEnv.sh (or SetEnv.csh) for building or using ports. (Remember to
 update to get the X11 fix though.)</p>

<p>Using a port is straight-forward, for example install your (well, my)
 favourite editor using:</p><pre>
	$ cd /usr/ports/editors/joe
	$ mmake install clean
	$ print export EDITOR=jupp &gt;&gt;~/.profile
</pre>


<h2 id="diffmir">Differences to MirOS #7</h2>

<p>There should be a complete change log, but we have about 30 MiB of
 CVS commit logs to read for writing one, so we're only listing the
 most important ones here:</p><ul>
<li>Much faster</li>
<li>Improved and portable MirPorts Framework</li>
<li>Updated lots of ports and base system programmes</li>

<li>Support for hardcoding ARP table entries at boot in /etc/arp.conf</li>
</ul>

<p>We're quite sure this list isn't complete and we might even have
 forgotten some change of major importance, but this should give you
 a good idea why to upgrade.</p>


<h2 id="diffopen">Differences to OpenBSD</h2>

<p>We always get asked how we compare to the other BSDs. Since we have
 originally forked off OpenBSD we'll list a few &quot;main differences&quot;
 (the list is nowhere complete, but a good start):</p><ul>
<li>No hot-tempered head developer</li>
<li>Portable porting framework</li>
<li>Much better infrastructure</li>
<li>Generic framework for wrapping GNU autotools</li>
<li>Up-to-date third-party tools (GNU Binutils, GCC, CVS, RCS, Sendmail,
 Perl, Lynx, Texinfo, X-Window, Libtool) avoiding the many porting errors</li>
<li>Compilers for C, C++, Objective-C, Pascal, (on i386) Java&trade;, Ada</li>
<li>Slim base system &ndash; no Kerberos, AFS, YP/NIS+, SMP, binary
 compatibility for unused operating systems, BIND, non-C code</li>
<li>ISDN support</li>
<li>Privacy improvements</li>
<li>Support for the i386 and (not now) sparc architectures</li>
<li>Feature enhancements in the Linux emulation</li>
<li>Binary compatibility to OpenBSD (almost 100%)</li>
<li>evilwm replaces wm2</li>
<li>We still use XFree86&trade; 4.5</li>
<li>BSD d&aelig;mon</li>
<li>Rewritten master and partition boot record with boot manager support</li>
<li>GENERIC kernel is used on <tt>bsd.rd</tt></li>
<li>The ramdisk contains a lot of rescue tools, even sshd(8)</li>
<li>Support for disabling <tt>fsck(8)</tt> for ffs filesystems with softdep
 enabled (default in the MirOS installer) in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
 Includes automatic sorting of the fstab file implemented in korn shell.</li>
<li>Highly improved set of shell script infrastructure using security
 features of the Korn shell, which is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> in MirOS. Automatic
 discovery of IDE hard disc drives which need their write cache disabled.</li>
<li>mksh(1) is the Korn shell, highly improved</li>
<li>CTM, growfs(8), ffsinfo, wtf(1)</li>
<li>TLS-enabled Lynx and Sendmail with automatically generated server
 certificate (boot-time) and CAcert.org support</li>
<li>AT&amp;T nroff instead of GNU groff</li>
<li>Default <tt>/etc/profile</tt> file for smoother user interface</li>
<li>Support for hardcoding ARP table entries at boot in /etc/arp.conf</li>
<li>Many more ports which are not in OpenBSD for political reasons</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
