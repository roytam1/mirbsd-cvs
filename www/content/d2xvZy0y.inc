<h1>MirBSD grows too fast</h1>
<p>This is an archived weblog of the development leading to <a
 href="/?main">MirOS</a>. All entries are courtesy of tg@ and historic.</p>
<h3>News <small><a href="#eof">bottom</a></small></h3>
<p>28.01.2003<br />I am going to update my own system, remove everything old
 stuff and build basic packages. Then I'll sign and upload stuff. Review in
 a while for status information.</p>
<p>Later that day<br />The snapshot has successfully been (historic:
 http://templeofhate.com/tglaser/obsd/) uploaded here and verified
 by checksums. It is available for download, http install and pgp verification
 of the RIPEMD-160 checksum file. This opens the development branch for MirBSD
 snapshot #3 and deems Snap#2 RC4 the RELEASE version.</p><hr style="width:33%" />
<p>03.02.2003<br />I found that it's better to not interrupt CTM while it's
 updating the CVS repo. But then, the 3000A base splitfile should be out, so
 I'm waiting for it. No updates scheduled in the next days. But I still hope
 to get the ELF patch after FOSDEM (where I'll test belgian beer).</p>
<p>04.02.2003<br />Got the ELF diff and an ELF snap (not installed, because
 OpenBSD and MirBSD differ too much). I'll start playing with it after <a
 href="http://www.fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>. In the meanwhile, tell Wim to
 make the <tt>OpenBSD-cvs 3000A base CTM</tt> delta. Thank you.</p>
<p>07.02.2003<br />Diary of a success - installation of ELF<br />
 Instead of going to FOSDEM today (which I couldn't yet for various reasons),
 I started ./sbin/mount of Todd Fries' ELF snapshot and got a result :)</p>
<p>Then I copied over ldconfig and ldconfig'd ./usr/lib/ of ELF, since my
 MirBSD system is fully static yet. Now I'm going to look for development
 stuff (gcc, binutils, etc.) and copy that over to /usr...<br />
 Being lazy, I just copy over the entire of usr/bin and usr/lib/gcc-lib;
 the first time I missed usr/libexec/ld.so though. Works fine now.<br />
 Well, do not forget editing /etc/mk.conf before issuing the make build.
 OTOH, we only process make build until the libs are built (and installed),
 since we have to build GCC 3.2 before that (using the newly built libs).<br />
 After issuing <tt>make obj</tt> *hint*, the "make build" command fails because
 the gcc can't create binaries. D'oh. Copy over .a libs from todd.<br />
 And don't forget *.o files.<br /> Then patch egcc, make update-patches and
 try to build it (and test) manually...<br /> Well, my libc.a makes ld throw
 an internal bfd error. Let's see what I can do...<br /> Found out why: the
 OpenBSD developers seem to always include SCCS info in the .o files, so they
 seem not to have looked at it: like this: <tt><br />
#if defined(SYSLIBC_SCCS)<br />
        .text<br />
 </tt> - you'd need to swap the order of these two lines... *sigh*<br />
 Also, there's a file called <tt>perform.h</tt> in gcc/config/i386/ which
 is not (yet or any more?) in egcs... gah!<br />
 After some bitching around, stealing stuff from the base system and other
 files, maybe egcc builds now. I'll go to bed, though.</p>
<hr />
<p>On CVS commit messages<br /> I decided to make a standard in CVS commit
 messages for MirBSD diffs: "pre-build" means "intended for a build, but
 not sure if complete (distfile lists, etc.)"; "post-build" means "make
 build and make release finished" (unless otherwise spoken, make release
 is not excluded). "intermediate" means "i'm too lazy to make build or even
 release"; "unstable", "development" and "broken" mean they should not be
 used unless you know what you do.</p>
<p>10.02.2003<br />After getting back from FOSDEM, I hacked gcc and g++ 3.2.1
 (no 3.2.2 yet) to succeed in ELF, and make a new set of diffs against nearly
 the same date as the last MirBSD a.out snapshot (since I don't dare to
 compile or even boot an ELF kernel yet - even if an ELF+LBA boot loader was
 promised to me on <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> by Henning.</p>
<p>11.02.2003<br />I successfully even built an ELF kernel, it's just that I
 have no idea how to boot it ;-)<br />Anyways, an ELF snapshot will make its
 ways to the new download place soon.</p>
<p>12.02.2003<br />After finding out <tt>httpd</tt> is not chrooted on TOH,
 I was able to make some more free space on the server. And I uploaded the
 first MirBSD ELF snapshot (called #2 too, because the code base is nearly the
 same) including obsd.*, my-ports.tgz and gcc/g++ packages. The boot loader is
 still missing, and there are still no shared libraries, but you can switch
 them on in /etc/mk.conf now. I left it out in order to ease transition.</p>
<p>15.02.2003<br />Minor one: added an include file in the machine/ area which
 drahn@ forgot to send me because *sigh* it was added, and not in the cvs repo
 before. Are there other ones as well? I want a boot loader!<br />
 Complete overhaul of editors/jupp port (jupprc and man page) as well.</p>
<p>16.02.2003<br />Well, past midnight of yesterday: added utf-8 support to
 sirc and made it parse iso-8859-1 still correctly. Well, I still do not speak
 even any little bit perl, but it sorta works...</p>
<p>16.02.2003<br />Seems as the djb man page distfile tarballs are
 irretrievable; that's why I started to mirror them.</p>
<p>23.02.2003<br />I compiled my local stuff dynamically, but it's still
 darn unstable. I should chat a bit with drahn@.<br />
 Update the ports diff, including INDEX. Found out that my dsirc[6] diffs
 were crap and needed to be updated. I hope they do work now.</p>
<p>23.02.2003<br />Startet re-synching the tree to -current (3.3-beta) after
 backing out everything ELF from /sys<br />Do not use yet. - Proves that
 many stuff was not really compiled with egcc ($CC). This sucks.</p>
<p>24.02.2003<br />Made both <tt>make build</tt> and <tt>make release</tt>
 succeed; some of the changes should have gone in earlier. OTOH, catching
 up with -current again will be another hassle.</p>
<p>28.02.2003<br />I got Transgaming WineX to compile with a bit of hassle,
 but it does not run (without Windows&reg; installed) yet. I'll investigate
 this further. - Probably I will update MirBSD only twice the next days;
 when 3.3 goes tagged and when 3.3-current/i386 becomes ELF.<br />
 Ha! I knew! Building just another a.out kernel is impossible!</p>
<p>28.02.2003<br />gcc 3.2.2 is driving me crazy. It ceases to build
 correctly, so switch back to gcc 3.2.1 - but backport nice changes like
 the revamped propolice and other stuff.<br />Booting ELF kernels works.</p>
<p>29.02.2003<br />Hmm, who has doubted it? MirBSD is now self-hosting again,
 thanks to Master drahn, who made it working. This will enable me to publish
 another official snapshot (#3) soon. The diffs (against CTM tho) are already
 up.</p>
<p>Making the snapshot. It is fairly interesting how much breaks in the very
 last moments. For now, there will be no shared object of libstdc++ v3.
 The pic library is installed, though.</p>
<hr />
<p>01.03.2003<br />No snapshot today, I've had way too many issues and lost
 over 40 emails. Maybe tomorrow.</p>
