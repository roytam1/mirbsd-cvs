 <p>I've been prodded by bsiegert@ to write here again. Curious, isn't
  it? After the last release I've been the only one to write here. But
  today is somehow unproductive... I can't get myself to do something;
  will probably hunt some autoconf bugs later. I got a new laptop HDD,
  80 GB and waaaaaay faster, and re-installed BSD. pb@openbsd, who has
  arrived at the OpenBSD booth @22C3 in the meantime, didn't recognise
  me as I showed up in front of him until I threatened to throw all 70
  or so MirOS CDs we have at them.</p>

 <p>Another very cold (outside) and hot (inside) day at the 22nd Chaos
  Communication Congress (Berlin, Germany). The &quot;others&quot; are
  out for food (bsiegert@, a friend of his and our booth slave), Thai,
  this time, while I'm still sitting here and just fixed mplayer (that
  included fixing and upgrading a shitload of other ports). Drinking a
  newly found thing, vanilla flavoured Soja melk, and a local delicacy
  (Fa&szlig;brause) I'm hacking away, while the NOC complains that we,
  all of us together, are using a mere 7% of the 16 Gbit/s uplink, and
  the CAcert.org guy is seemingly confused (but they at least do their
  thing so that it WFM).</p>
 <p>Opera segfaults, and I guess my next target will be porting ptrace
  support for the Linuxulator from NetBSD&reg;, or asking Kurt Miller,
  who seems to have already done it, for his patch. Drinking more milk
  and juice and less alcohol during the night time should also help...
  but I'm more sleepy than really tired. They offer Club-Mate, but not
  the brother IceT, so I'm left off the caffe&iuml;ne circle (coffee's
  too expensive as well).</p>
 <p>I notice I can't write coherent &quot;day-to-day palaver&quot; log
  entries... I s'pose I should go back to coding. Who is going to read
  this anyway? People are busy complaining the FTP servers are slow (I
  think FTP deserves to die <b>fast</b> anyway).</p>
