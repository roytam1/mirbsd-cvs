<p>We finally have a new release, over two years after #7! To
celebrate this event, rotate the wlog and start a new one.</p>

 <p>I've been prodded by bsiegert@ to write here again. Curious, isn't
  it? After the last release I've been the only one to write here. But
  today is somehow unproductive... I can't get myself to do something;
  will probably hunt some autoconf bugs later. I got a new laptop HDD,
  80 GB and waaaaaay faster, and re-installed BSD. pb@openbsd, who has
  arrived at the OpenBSD booth @22C3 in the meantime, didn't recognise
  me as I showed up in front of him until I threatened to throw all 70
  or so MirOS CDs we have at them.</p>

 <p>Another very cold (outside) and hot (inside) day at the 22nd Chaos
  Communication Congress (Berlin, Germany). The &quot;others&quot; are
  out for food (bsiegert@, a friend of his and our booth slave), Thai,
  this time, while I'm still sitting here and just fixed mplayer (that
  included fixing and upgrading a shitload of other ports). Drinking a
  newly found thing, vanilla flavoured Soy milk, and a local specialty
  (Fa&szlig;brause) I'm hacking away, while the NOC complains that we,
  all of us together, are using a mere 7% of the 16 Gbit/s uplink, and
  the CAcert.org guy is seemingly confused (but they at least do their
  thing so that it WFM).</p>
 <p>Opera segfaults, and I guess my next target will be porting ptrace
  support for the Linuxulator from NetBSD&reg;, or asking Kurt Miller,
  who seems to have already done it, for his patch. Drinking more milk
  and juice and less alcohol during the night time should also help...
  but I'm more sleepy than really tired. They offer Club-Mate, but not
  the brother IceT, so I'm left off the caffe&iuml;ne circle (coffee's
  too expensive as well).</p>
 <p>I notice I can't write coherent &quot;day-to-day palaver&quot; log
  entries... I s'pose I should go back to coding. Who is going to read
  this anyway? People are busy complaining the FTP servers are slow (I
  think FTP deserves to die <b>fast</b> anyway).</p>

 <p>I am writing this just after midnight, so the second day of 22C3 has
  just ended. Did some updated ports for GNOME 2.12.2, hopefully I will
  have it finished by the time GNOME 2.14 comes out&nbsp;...</p>
 <p>I saw three more or less interesting talks today. The first one was by
  Dan Kaminsky is called "Black Ops Of TCP/IP 2005.5". He basically showed
  what you can do with a <i>really</i> fat pipe: scan the entire internet!
  He also showed a real-time traffic graphing tool and an estimate of the
  number of machines infected by the Sony rootkit: at least 700.000
  machines, more likely over a million. To quote <a
  href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/11/sonys_drm_rootk.html">Bruce
  Schneier</a>: "What happens when the creators of malware collude with the
  very companies we hire to protect us from that malware?"</p>
 <p>After that, there as a talk about <a
  href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/">PyPy</a>, a Python implementation
  written in Python. This actually makes sense because it is self-hosting
  and it can translate Python code into C and even JavaScript for native
  compilation. The third talk was a real highlight -- "Das literarische
  Code-Quartett". Examples of good and bad code, commented in a very fun
  way. Definitely a must.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20051230">30.12.2005 by tg@</h3>
 <p>The chaos continues. But some real work is done &ndash; we now can
  support the scenario &quot;some shared library depends on another of
  their kind&quot; (for now, only unofficially, but it will be MFCs by
  bsiegert@ I think).</p>
 <p>Today is clean-up and go day. We asked the people from OpenBSD (we
  have to clean up and work, no time), NetBSD&reg; (they want to drive
  away early, like 18:00, due to the weather), DragonFly BSD (they say
  there will be ice rain so they'll hunt home at 15:00) to eat with us
  at the great Indian restaurant, and FreeBSD didn't even show up (the
  same procedure as every year). But we're gaining popularity not only
  among the other BSDs, but as well with the congress participiants (a
  spokesman calling them "Dear congress... err... people" in a speaker
  announcement).</p>
 <p>Some media are writing off each other, leading to people believing
  we have released MirOS Windows XP or something. We had to unconfuse;
  we hope to be able to correct this mistake in each publication where
  it shows up.</p>
 <p>I've got headaches. Everything is being broken down, including the
  big HP switches, so the network'll probably cease to exist RSN. Benz
  is watching a last presentation, then we'll head to the Indian, then
  back home. See you all in the new (christian/western) year!</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060101">01.01.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>I've hacked on an enforcement for ports versioning and drafted the
  "package era" scheme we'll probably be using, pending results of the
  discussion with all other active MirPorts developers (hrhr).</p>
 <p>The INDEX was regenerated after I fixed several ports with damaged
  version numbers but the versions used before that are quite probably
  <em>not</em> upgradable.</p>
 <p>sirc and ssfe are now capable of displaying "cool looking" unicode
  (and ASCII) time stamps.</p>
 <p>I changed all my (user and root) passwords and generated a new ssh
  key after returning from 22C3 (where I shut down the boxen remotely,
  as the last thing before they switched off the network). This is the
  best thing to do, since keys and passwords should be rotated yearly,
  or at least periodically, anyway, and I can't think of a better time
  than after the Chaos Communication Congress.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060102">02.01.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>I've ordered a new dedicated server which will cost me a lot less,
  namely 19.90 &euro; the first 18 months and then 29 &euro; (also per
  month) with the same functionality at the same hoster. I'm compiling
  a new snapshot these days to set it up with this &ndash; so thor has
  outlived and will not be continued, but switching will not be a pain
  either.</p>
 <p>My friend <tt>bogus</tt> was here for a bottle of Met and just did
  the same. The new hostnames will be fungor (his choice) and... well,
  &#39764;&#29579; (&#12414;&#12362;&#12358;) is mine. The meal we had
  at the yugoslawian (croatian) was tasteful, by the way.</p>
 <p>I baked an Atheros kernel for <tt>gecko2</tt>'s Soekris net4801 he
  purchased (which was formerly known as <tt>loki</tt>) which works...
  much to my surprise. But it's not ready for commit, e.g. I nuked the
  wi(4) support to compile, ifconfig(8) doesn't operate properly, etc.
  (but he can access wireless LANs with it). I wouldn't buy ath(4) tho
  (I just don't trust them).</p>
 <p>I somehow miss bsiegert@ here &ndash; there's lots of fixes he may
  (should) be doing now...</p>
 <p>Somehow we're gaining <a
  href="http://www.pro-linux.de/news/2005/9093.html">good</a> <a
  href="http://www.symlink.ch/article.pl?sid=05/12/30/1030208&amp;mode=nested">press</a>
  and <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=13124#79739">user reviews</a> (and <a
  href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=13124&amp;offset=20#80467">slander</a> which shows
  that the &quot;others&quot; are not only recognising us but also see
  us as dangerous to them (their popularity? user base? I've converted
  at least one OpenBSD person to MirOS during 22C3). Nice to know.</p>
 <p>I tought bogus some MirPorts and upgraded the ext2fs-progs port in
  the meantime (also adding a static flavour later, to benefit a weird
  setup of my new dedicated server). The idea is to have a 16 MiB wd0a
  with a partition ID != 0x27, containing a /boot installed with -P as
  to recognise the partition, and one or two ramdisk kernels, and some
  text files (e.g. disklabel, fdisk output). Then, a 16 MiB extfs with
  a gzip'd image of the first 16 MiB (including MBR, PBR, 4.2BSD FFS),
  a stand-alone MBR, and what else you could need to recover. The rest
  is a standard 0x27 partition with the wd0a of a regular boot, /home,
  swap, whatever. The "irregular" wd0a need not even be in there.</p>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060113">13.01.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>I've fixed a few things (code cleanliness) and built a snapshot to
  see if it works (another one &ndash; there was one on 03.01. already
  which bsiegert@ has announced today at freshmeat). This one also has
  taken care of the always changing domains. I'm updating MirOS #8 (by
  mkdir updates) with current MirPorts as well.</p>
 <p>My little brother and bogus came here, teaching me Maths, drinking
  Met and having fun, after a good meal. I need it; university is some
  weird shit, something else really. It's not my favourite but I still
  want to do 2 semesters before going to work (so I can continue later
  if I want).</p>
 <p>Nothing else in peculiar... bsiegert@ has got a girlfriend, thusly
  #8-stable is lagging quite a bit. My new dedicated server also could
  need some more attention.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060115">15.01.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>Things are settling down... installed software on &#39764;&#29579;
  but still not complete. It now does mail (for all domains), OpenVPN,
  a minimalistic www proxy, and of course NTP and its own (non-public)
  DNS. But that's about it. Time will show.<br />Also, I need to phone
  the hoster regarding the domain issues. They're worse than appearing
  at first, since the wildcard is gone.</p>
 <p>Fixed some annoying minor bugs in roff2htm and /cvs/CVSROOT.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060117">17.01.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>Wow, I've been attending university once again. This time for that
  #1 boring thing &ndash; Economics (BWL), held by a female VWL doctor
  with a voice more cruel than should be allowed... at least we do not
  have to do an exam, only attend and do a presentation and home work.
  And I scored well in English (the other class in which attendance is
  mandatory). I've worked on my Maths, and theorectical CS is trivial.
  But as for the others, I don't know. Plus in the beginning they told
  us that we would automatically be subscribed for the exams &ndash; I
  was told today I should better have done that myself in December. So
  I probably can't do any exams except English this semester.</p>
 <p>Been working on djbdns today, once again. Now I've incorportated a
  lot more patches (from tinydns.org) and can do AXFR via inetd(8). So
  I will probably use AXFR and NOTIFY requests in the future, with two
  friends (bogus and maybe gecko2 or someone else) doing backup NS for
  me (and HERC might still do too, but using classical rsync/scp). And
  the best thing: it actually works and required virtually no patches.
  There's still no (working) UCSPI-TCP port though. We did have one in
  the past, from OpenBSD, but it never worked correctly, nor addressed
  all the issues we had with it. (DJB sucks.)</p>
 <p>I discovered more bugs in pkg_upgrade(8) which bsiegert@ hopefully
  will fix (or at least decide which fix is correct, I can think of at
  least three possible fixes, preferring the one most complex).</p>
 <p>I had announced the <a href="/?clog-2006#snap0113">snapshot of Jan
  13</a> on FM and it actually showed up.</p>
 <p><tt>*.mirsolutions.de</tt> works, once again. Costly phone call to
  the provider sponsored by yours truly. Now go and <a href="/?danke">
  donate</a> some money via PayPal.</p>
 <p><a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.miros.general/1635">The
  comment</a> on the GPLv3 actually got modded <tt>+1, Insightful</tt>
  on <a href="http://www.symlink.lu/">Symlink</a>, the German slashdot

  LinuxTag Karlsruhe (now Wiesbaden, where ever that may be) for us...
  we've organised a BSD room (the orga team are drinking mates of mine
  so it wasn't too difficult). DragonFly BSD will come (per Joerg) and
  Wim will obviously attend. NetBSD&reg; hopefully will appear too; as
  for FreeBSD&reg; I couldn't ask them since they weren't there (again
  as usual) at 22C3. <a href="http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20060117101506&amp;mode=expanded">The

 <p>Published a cpio ball of ocvs+ncvs1 and historic. bsiegert@ agreed
  they be closed and sealed now. It's only on herc and maou tho.</p>
 <p>Slowly going on with setting up maou. After all, thor''ll cease to

 <p>Removed ads. G**gle closed my account for supposed abuse.</p>
 <p>Added Debian GNU/Linux i386 emulation libs; makes Opera work. I'll

 <p>Enough for today. Gotta do some work; then dinner at the Croatian,
  with wbx, le, Angelo (the first Mac OSX worm creator), Judith, miro,

 <p>Got something decent to eat, drink (beer, cola) and snack. Hacked,
  djbdns-axfr, sirc/ssfe now improved, savecore(8) does gzip(1)d files
  and the zlib API sucks. compress(1)' implementation also sucks.</p>
 <p>All hardware sucks, all software sucks... but actually the overall

 <p>Oh, already last day of the semester? (Well, tomorrow. Luckily, so
  I've still a minimal chance to be allowed to take exams this time...
  I better should; on 30th of January, the first one is scheduled). In
  English I graduated with an 1.3 (that's like 96%), and Economics was
  taken for granted.</p>
 <p>I fixed php5-core but encountered a package tools bug which Benny,
  hopefully, will fix. I've also redesigned my keyboard layout since I
  don't read Japanese anyway, but having Umlauts (Meta-style) in Opera
  is more important (and I've got back my Ellipsis ;). I get &auml; by
  pressing either Meta-d or Mode_switch-d (and not Mode_switch-a which
  was used by dot.Xmodmap.light for DAUs) as I'm used to from the text
  console, wscons(4).</p>
 <p>I was thrown out of Netzladen today... no idea if I'll continue to
  hang around there. Probably not, saves me 4 &euro; monthly.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, this leaded to an unexpected, not-Mate-induced,
  peak in productivity, not only yielding a much cooler, artistic, new
  keyboard layout, but to the release of <a href="/?jupp">joe-3.1jupp5
  </a> as well.</p>
 <p>And because I didn't find this, admittedly older, reference in the
  bookmark list I keep, I thought I don't want to keep it from you, as
  it's also my opinion on trends and AJAX: Felix von Leitner speaks on

 <p>Wow, exactly one month since I have written my last wlog entry.
  After 22C3, I have done very little work on MirOS, owing to two
  factors: my girlfriend and the january exams (seven of them!). The
  latter are over now, and I feel confident about the results for
  courses like Optics, Solid State Physics and (worst of all)
  Statistical Properties of Polymers, to name but a few.</p>
 <p>I am still struggling with firefox 1.5 and its component libs.
  The problem seems to be related to shared library interdependencies.
  The current state of my port might work on -current. I could just
  churn out an update of #8-stable that contains the linker bugfix and
  have that as a minimum requirement.</p>
 <p>What else? If you have the opportunity, go see <a
  href="http://www.luecke-im-system.de/"><i>L&uuml;cke im System</i></a>
  (the original title is <i>Absolut</i>) at a cinema. IMHO, it is the
  first "hacker" movie which is credible both in story and technical
  aspects. And what makes it all the more frightening is that the movie
  is based on a true story. The synopsis: Two friends develop a virus
  which one of them has to install at a bank. He wakes up in the
  hospital two days later, having had an accident after work that day.
  He has lost any recollection of that day. What has happened? Did he
  really install the virus? Are <i>they</i> after him?</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060130">30.01.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>Benny, do you still live in 2005? ;-)</p>
 <p>I managed to appear at two exams today, finally: Operating Systems 1
  and Technical Computer Science 1 (basically, Physics and Electronics).
  I hope I've passed both but actually I am not sure. Weird stuff.</p>
 <p>There's an mksh R26c with a few updates, and this one is about to be
  submitted to Debian again. I wonder when Gentoo will update.</p>
 <p>I'm pondering to update Lynx but I'd like to have a libiconv to link
  with so I can enable japanese-utf8 support. On other news, I still got
  no answer from Bruno Haible, maybe I should mail him again. We need to
  have that libutf8 code.</p>
 <p>I'd make a snapshot and install &#39764;&#29579; for the second time
  but there's still an infrastructure bug pending in ports, some samples
  checks by Benny, and a few other port fixes, so I'll probably postpone
  it another while. This sucks but we can bear with it; thor is still up
  and running stable enough for a while (yet can't test new ports, sigh)
  and the redirection is working for now; no abundant traffic. The state
  of the base system is quite well, it's only ports which need more work
  (much more). Of course there are a few bugs, but that's normal, you'll
  have to live with them as usual. We try to fix them, though.</p>
 <p>Dang! Hubert Feyrer has changed his "blog software" so I must update
  the hyperlinks. (Scripts around vi(1)? What were you thinking? To do a
  thing like that... you script ed(1)!) I've sent him some more material
  for his fun pages &ndash; reading symlink is still worth it sometimes,
  but rarely.</p>
 <p>I at <a href="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2006/info/">Chemnitzer
  Linuxtage</a>? Possible, if someone sponsors me. I must get there (and
  back) safely &ndash; by train or, preferred, car sharing with somebody
  from the Bonn region, and live there somewhere (a place to sleep). Any
  offers? <a href="mailto:tg@mirbsd.de">Mail</a> me.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060131">31.01.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>bsiegert@ will probably kill me, or use some other means of violence
  (who knows), but at least it's done. mgcc(1) now aborts if CFLAGS (and
  COPTS, or rather, _DEFCOPTS) are not honoured, with an optional abort,
  not yet active, if they are given twice. This depends on a variable to
  be set in the environment, thus doesn't affect manual builds except by
  an informal note.</p>
 <p>We now have mmap(2) malloc(3), TCP tuning diffs (SYN packets 4 bytes
  smaller), and my libc is still working. I am amazed. I will rebuild my
  entire system then.</p>
 <p>nl_langinfo(CODESET), citrus iconv(3), security-fixed perl(1)... now
  he just can't kill me ;) Also did some major www updates to keep track
  of source changes (still commented out though).</p>
 <p>More later... if I'm still living by then ;)</p>
 <p>Seems as if Benny is sleeping... weird, he said his exams period was
  over... fixed build of base system, so I could do a snapshot again, if
  I wanted (and ports were ready - damn pkgtools bug).</p>
 <p>h2ph(1) was indeed used, but it seems to be minor. gcc now builds as
  well (non-C languages just ignore -fhonour-copts which seems easier to
  me), except libjava which I didn't test due to tiredness (lack of time
  and sleep).</p>
 <p>I somehow expect iconv(3) and nl_langinfo(3) CODESET support to have
  some impact on something... but nothing until now. Wait to see whether
  we rename libcitrus_iconv to libiconv (selection via -L works).</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060201">01.02.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>I've been working on libiconv integration into MirPorts today which,
  the way I did it, also benefits Darwin. I also hacked a bit on varouus
  iconv(3)-using ports including centericq, and changed the linuxulator,
  respectively the porting framework, so that opera runs better.</p>
 <p>Should I really go to the exam tomorrow? Chances are I get 40% while
  to pass you need to have more than 50%.</p>
 <p>Soryu (&#x60e3;&#x6d41;&#x30fb;&#x30a2;&#x30b9;&#x30ab;&#x30fb;&#x30e9;&#x30f3;&#x30b0;&#x30ec;&#x30fc;
  is his nickname, "Stanley Rost" is the real name according to his CMS'
  copyright) pointed me via <a href="http://mirbsd.de/irc">IRC</a> to an
  ambiente stream at radioio.com &ndash; a site which offers two quality
  variants on the website (AM quality and FM quality, wtf?)<br />Now the
  fun part: Opera opens a pop-up and offers to download an m3u file when
  asking for an mp3 stream (thank goddess, I only have mpg123 installed,
  playing music on the pentium &#x2160; router). The filename: A1med.m3u
  (this of course raises suspicions) &ndash; so I test-run the AM stream
  and get presented an A1lo.m3u. Interesting. Viewing the source it's an
  easy task to see the URI, so I ftp(1) A1hi.m3u which in fact exists! I
  guess it's a subscriber-only feature, but 128 kbps 44k1Hz J/S MP3 is a
  lot better than 64 kbps 22k05Hz J/S, isn't it? Now I'm listening to <a
  href="http://radioio.sc.llnwd.net:8610/">the stream</a> and will sleep
  (or at least try to). I decided that I have no chance to pass the exam
  scheduled for tomorrow, that's the only reason to still be awake.</p>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060202">02.02.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>So, I did sleep long and not take the exam. I would not have passed,
  anyway.</p>
 <p>Some lazy day today, but I'll continue hacking on various stuff. And
  (as announced) I broke mySQL for there is no maintainer. We have real,
  happy, users of MirOS who also appear in IRC, so I fixed a few things,
  based upon their feedback. Also I persuaded a bunch of BSD guys to add
  <tt>#bsd</tt> (or even <tt>#mirbsd</tt>) on Freeforge to their connect
  list and autojoin.</p>
 <p>Tomorrow I'll have to do a few different things over the day, so may
  not have the time to work on MirOS.</p>

 <p>Still trouble with my life cycle. Getting up early nearly killed me,
  so I slept during noon a little while. But at least there are a few of
  my friends still not leaving me.</p>
 <p>I must admit that I'm spending a larger amount than I used to or I'd
  like to, even, on "common" internet activity &ndash; chatting (Jabber,
  ICQ, MSN, Yahoo, IRC) and web-based message boards (with Opera). It is
  not what I'd like to do but there are a few persons I got to know over
  time. Besides, with Benny spending time with a girlfriend... which I'm
  still hoping to eventually acquire as well.</p>
 <p>I started a bulk build and, annoyed by the crap we took over from "a
  BSD focusing on clean code", did some major commits. This probably has
  broken some more stuff but I'm doing bulk builds to see where. I won't
  fix ports which don't build (except for the easy cases) just mark them
  as ${BROKEN}, so we at least know.</p>
 <p>Does anyone still have wishes for the next snapshot? I'm about ready
  to build one. Except for ports, as usual. Lack of communication can be
  quite annoying.</p>
 <p>With mmap(2) malloc(3) we need the OpenBSD X11 fixes ported. I asked
  ciruZ already, but if someone volunteers, please say so since it's not
  yet clear whether he will try it at least.</p>
 <p>That's all, folks. If I got more feedback I'd write more, besides, I
  don't even know which topics are of interest to you.</p>

 <p>Benny is in Japan now &ndash; nice, eh? I think I'd better get a new
  snapshot built and &#39764;&#29579; installed before it's too late for
  merging the old server. I've played a bit with the build system though
  (some stuff I always wanted to re-do, if we weren't going for syspkgs,
  there was more work in that area).</p>
 <p>At the moment, no lectures at university, I'm sleeping too long (and
  too much probably) and not getting anything productive done. I already
  am waiting for FOSDEM but probably can't go to CLT.</p>
 <p>Ports are in a rather questionable state, I'm prepared having to fix
  everything on maou prior to installing. Someone ought to continue bulk
  build and break work.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060215">15.02.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>Built a snapshot in an overnighter. Have fun, help testing. Caution,
  ports are a mess.</p>
 <p>No idea how I can tell Benny by different means... we've got a place
  to stay in Leuven &ndash; 2 developers, 2 Trittbrettfahrer.</p>

 <p>I've been outside a lot, but under-the-hood FOSDEM planning coninues
  and we'll probably have CDs with yet another new snapshot, and I ought
  to bring the MirShirts with me as well.</p>
 <p>Hacked a little on vnconfig(8) (in preparation for the key file hack
  inspired by GeNUA's Marcus Popp) and ssh(1), sshd(8) (in order to make
  them exchange randomness with the peer (via our own arc4random_push(3)
  interface so it's strictly optional).</p>
 <p>Also added a workaround to lynx(1) to improve handling of the broken
  CAcert.org website. Fix comes later.</p>
 <p>bsiegert@ actually phoned me today, meaning he still lives...</p>
 <p>I've updated the essentials/pkgtools port after fixing a few bugs in
  pkg_upgrade. I've also updated mc (difficult, and I don't like some of
  the changes) and, finally, mirex (contrib/samples) (even with the new,
  not yet in use, gzsig(1) key but still without bsiegert@ having looked
  whether his information is correct). Makes me wonder if the version of
  that port is now correct...</p>
 <p>Forcing USE_CXX=no ports to use 'false' as ${CXX} since now.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060221">21.02.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>Today I just was in a hacking mood and besides updating ssh(1) wrote
  vnconfig(8) keyfile support from scratch using PEM, fixed djb fetching
  of distfiles, updated and fixed misc/mc for good, helped porters which
  need iconv.m4, added SQLite2 to php-core and a little advertising (for
  the MirPorts Framework), hacked net/openvpn the same as ssh, fixed the
  arc4random_push(3) stuff I use for months in the kernel, so that it is
  finally usable, did a few man pages and build improvements, even fixed
  a lot of OpenSSH code regarding to gcc warnings.</p>
 <p>bsiegert@ actually showed up in IRC today... did not do much though.
  I wonder whether we'll be able to do FOSDEM like we want, since I'm in
  the mood for everything save housework which includes washing clothes,
  for example certain t-shirts.</p>

 <p>Commit ID: 10043FE5D720803A93E and 10043FE634705689581. I don't want
  to continue any more. Fuck, if &#39764;&#29579; had not frozen (due to
  the heat probably) we've had had a snapshot by end of 22nd of February
  already. Now thor has aborted with a sig11 in a libjava build and only
  odem is left compiling (my laptop, at 100% CPU speed of 1200 MHz AMD).
  It would have completed the task with no problem if there had not been
  minor (gcc -W* not realising an uninitialised variable was being used)
  as well as major (use of libcrypto) trouble in vnconfig(8), save a few
  other problems. I'm doing extra shifts and still cannot guarantee that
  what we'll sell at FOSDEM will build again when you try, or work as it
  is expected. (I did test vnconfig(8) though, not all modi tho...)</p>
 <p>Again, I'm so bored and sick of computers, but can't help it, FOSDEM
  is a duty. At least we got ourselves included on the flyers by AllBSD,
  to be presented at FOSDEM too, thanks to the work of Daniel and others
  (including overnighters). And I'm still trying to finish a functioning
  and not embarrassing ISO image.</p>
 <p>When it comes to hardware trouble I'm quite helpless. I'd like to be
  able to have some holidays, too. Being stuck at home (time between the
  semesters) doesn't help, it only gives you spare time to sleep (really
  too) much and not getting any real work done.</p>
 <p>Oh, by the way... virtually nobody remembered my birthday. The folks
  at #UnixNL were very friendly, though.</p>

 <p>Commit ID: 10043FF4D4816FF87C6 &ndash; it gets worse.</p>
 <p>While I had a good afternoon, I'm slightly pissed now. bogus said no
  and won't join us for FOSDEM. I hope ciruZ gets persuaded enough, also
  we won't go today but tomorrow at 05:00 CET instead, so he'll get some
  more spare time to prepare.</p>
 <p>This also gives me time to make a FOSDEM snapshot... dating the 25th
  then, probably.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060224b">somewhen VERY EARLY before FOSDEM 2006, by tg@</h3>
 <p>Yataa! I did it! We have got an apparently working CD9660 image of a
  new snapshot, to be released at FOSDEM. I'm burning a CD-R, just to be
  sure, now, that nothing goes wrong AGAIN even in the very case of this
  laptop not working any more (but it does WELL, thanks Acer!).</p>
 <p>Now it's 05:15 CET and we should be driving in the very direction of

 <p>FOSDEM is over, my visitor <tt>gecko2</tt> has left and my room is a
  little bit cleaned up (mostly thanks to him ;).</p>
 <p>I think it was a success (we earned more than OpenBSD on saturday if
  I'm reading Saad Kadhi's photos correctly, and we sold FOUR T-Shirts).
  FOSDEM is the most fun event anyway.</p>
 <p>We might have a person interested in kernel development soon...</p>
 <p>Found a panic (regarding timeout(9) not initialised) in ahc(4) (or a
  SCSI subsystem not touched by atapiscsi(4)) by trying to cdparanoiarip
  a dirty CD-ROM. Can't investigate though.</p>
 <p>I'm not doing much work on MirOS now, priorising &#39764;&#29579; to
  be set up correctly soon. Sorry guys.</p>
 <p>Benny is back in Strasbourg (France) and I hope he'll join us people
  working on MirOS again soon if his girlfriend allows... I'm also still
  expecting a wlog entry from his &#x65e5;&#x672c; holiday.</p>

 <p style="margin-bottom:0px;">I really ought to make a new page, out of

 <div style="border:4px ridge blue; margin:0px 24px 0px 24px; padding:12px;">
 <!-- begin -->
	<h2 id="diffmir">Differences to MirOS #7</h2>

	<p>There should be a complete change log, but we have about 30 MiB of
	 CVS commit logs to read for writing one, so we're only listing the
	 most important ones here:</p><ul>
	<li>Much faster</li>

	</ul>

	<p>We're quite sure this list isn't complete and we might even have
	 forgotten some change of major importance, but this should give you
	 a good idea why to upgrade.</p>


	<h2 id="diffopen">Differences to OpenBSD</h2>

	<p>We always get asked how we compare to the other BSDs. Since we have
	 originally forked off OpenBSD we'll list a few &quot;main differences&quot;
	 (the list is nowhere complete, but a good start):</p><ul>
	<li>No hot-tempered head developer</li>
	<li>Portable porting framework</li>
	<li>Much better infrastructure</li>
	<li>Generic framework for wrapping GNU autotools</li>
	<li>Up-to-date third-party tools (GNU Binutils, GCC, CVS, RCS, Sendmail,
	 Perl, Lynx, Texinfo, X-Window, Libtool) avoiding the many porting errors</li>
	<li>Compilers for C, C++, Objective-C, Pascal, (on i386) Java&trade;, Ada</li>
	<li>Slim base system &ndash; no Kerberos, AFS, YP/NIS+, SMP, binary
	 compatibility for unused operating systems, BIND, non-C code</li>
	<li>ISDN support</li>
	<li>Privacy improvements</li>
	<li>Support for the i386 and (not now) sparc architectures</li>
	<li>Feature enhancements in the Linux emulation</li>
	<li>Binary compatibility to OpenBSD (almost 100%)</li>
	<li>evilwm replaces wm2</li>
	<li>We still use XFree86&trade; 4.5</li>
	<li>BSD d&aelig;mon</li>
	<li>Rewritten master and partition boot record with boot manager support</li>
	<li>GENERIC kernel is used on <tt>bsd.rd</tt></li>
	<li>The ramdisk contains a lot of rescue tools, even sshd(8)</li>
	<li>Support for disabling <tt>fsck(8)</tt> for ffs filesystems with softdep
	 enabled (default in the MirOS installer) in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
	 Includes automatic sorting of the fstab file implemented in korn shell.</li>
	<li>Highly improved set of shell script infrastructure using security
	 features of the Korn shell which is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> in MirOS. Automatic
	 discovery of IDE hard disc drives which need their write cache disabled.</li>
	<li>mksh(1) is the Korn shell, highly improved</li>
	<li>CTM, growfs(8), ffsinfo, wtf(1)</li>
	<li>TLS-enabled Lynx and Sendmail with automatically generated server
	 certificate (boot-time) and CAcert.org support</li>
	<li>AT&amp;T nroff instead of GNU groff</li>
	<li>Default <tt>/etc/profile</tt> file for smoother user interface</li>
	<li>Support for hardcoding ARP table entries at boot in /etc/arp.conf</li>
	<li>Many more ports which are not in OpenBSD for political reasons</li>
	</ul>
 <!-- end; --></div>
 <p style="margin-top:0px;">... and more.</p>
 <p>Built a cross-compiler to i386-gnu-linux-gnu with Debian GNU/Linux's
  libs and headers. Built printf(1) - all other tools I attempted didn't
  work: sh(1) mksh(1) date(1) id(1) and maybe more. GCC also builds okay
  natively (tested that, including libjava - poor odem).</p>
 <p>Next up is bringing the sparc (32-bit) port back in shape. Some nice
  discussions with Tonnerre in IRC reaffirm my decision to not ever have
  a sparc64 port (gcc sucks). i386 is our primary platform, sparc and in
  the future amd64 will be secondary platforms, with the option to add a
  macppc or alpha port if Benny or Tonnerre are up to the task.</p>
 <p>To the curious reader: I will import OpenBSD 3.9-STABLE at some time
  into the vendor branch and merge it all. But at the moment, sparc will
  come first because we have got actual customers ;) hi CcSsNET</p>
 <p>gcc 4.1.0 is out &ndash; all I can do is laugh at the bug list shown
  in <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.announce/29">their
  release announcement</a>... GNU Tar (a version with a known (directory
  traversal, I think) bug), and the other thing, and that gcc 4.1.1 will
  take another two months (wondering what else will go wrong). Positive,
  however, is the ProPolice &#x2161; built-in support and that it's said
  it runs on Interix unpatched. I wonder if we should better make a port
  out of it (for MirPorts) instead of our system compiler &ndash; OTOH I
  think many people (centericq on OpenBSD users, for instance) benefit a
  lot of a mgcc(1) mirport...</p>
 <p>I'll visit my best friend tomorrow, stay until sunday evening, so no
  internet for me (no computer at all, even). Probably he'll be the only
  person to celebrate (post morten ;) my birthday with. Not many people,
  as usual, remembered it anyway. (He forgot it too.) But I nevertheless
  had had a great time. No, I won't tell.</p>
 <p>My mobile phone (&gt; 6 years old Trium Astral) is making trouble...
  the first time since about a year it has had this kind of error (shows
  connection to a GSM provider but it's away as soon as I try to place a
  call). Any ideas? No, I won't change cell phones. Only fix.</p>
 <p>No idea what else to write. BENNY! I'm still waiting!</p>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060319">19.03.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>I haven't been as lazy (or, well, occupied) yesterday and today as I
  was before (despite stomach illness) and started migrating thor to the
  new dedicated server which is now also running IRC, VPN, etc. and uses
  sophisticated firewalling. In the process, I have fixed a bug (code vs
  documentation) in readlink(1) and updated some ports. Today I also ran
  through style(9) and made it consistent, even discovered (undocumented
  switch) the Bill Shannon mode of indent(1) doing to <b>sizeof</b> what
  we want.</p>
 <p>Since thor is going to be defunct in two, three days, I will have to
  work some more to &quot;make it&quot;. Also I'm setting up DNS anew; I
  will still be using MirDNS as DynDNS clone with heartbeat protocol and
  djbdns as backend on maou and herc, but Tonnerre and TGEN offered me a
  backup NS each which I'll gladly be using provided NOTIFY and AXFR are
  working properly. I also enhanced inetd(8) by DJB ucspi-tcp compatible
  environment variables.</p>
 <p>Maybe I'll use <tt>mirbsd.org</tt> as primary domain now and the old
  <tt>66h.42h.de</tt> will serve as fallback in case &#39764;&#29579; is
  unreachable (it's pretty stable unless I try to build a snapshot).</p>
 <p>I bought a Nokia 6150 (old enough so I know I can use it) via ePray,
  still waiting for it to arrive (and hopefully a PSU too). I do already
  have the leather bag though... doesn't help me much.</p>
 <p>Seems like spring is coming. Still cold but good bearable in the sun
  which is shining quite well the last few days.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060323">23.03.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>thor's gone, maou's running... sort of. There is still trouble, with
  the MirDNS #3 code for example, but I got it sort of running (like the
  old server, without some of the improvements) for now.</p>
 <p>maou's making trouble with the hardware, though approximately thirty
  passes of <a href="http://www.memtest86.com/">memtest86</a> don't show
  any error at all. Maybe heat? CPU issues? It just freezes, no panic or
  any serial console output or syslog at all.</p>
 <p>I've written a <a href="/content/utf2html.sh">helper</a>, converting
  UTF-8 to SGML entities, for Benny to write a larger wlog entry. It can
  convert basically any UTF-8 because it's a simple (slow) shell script,
  making use of iconv(1) and hexdump(1); output is decimal entities (not
  sedecimal/hexadecadic) for better portability, and ASCII is passed and
  not converted to &amp;amp;, &amp;lt;, and &amp;gt;, so he can use HTML
  already in the input.</p>
 <p>Caught a flu, not bad after still recovering from stomach stuff.</p>
 <p>Trying to figure out my timetable for the summer semester. Really it
  is not trivial at all. Though after all I'll probably won't study (for
  real) anyway.</p>
 <p>Please do not forget to update your sendmail.</p>
 <p>I should probably write much more here, but... nah, unfunny.</p>
 <p>Read the <a href="http://porting-unix-to-the-386.jolix.com/">summary
  about porting (Berkeley) Unix to the i386 architecture</a> by the well
  known Jolitzens. Some interesting facts. Found at D&aelig;monnews.</p>

 <p>What do we do with maou? It froze again this night. In my opinion we
  ought to provide stable services, but how the hell am I supposed to if
  I do not even get a kernel panic? I'm starting to think whether to set
  up some kind of "ping watchdog" with automatic web interface reboot in
  a shell script.</p>

 <p>I've come, again, to the conclusion that it all sucks. Interestingly
  I discovered (yeah, right, didn't even know) that ntpd(8) is on the CD
  (yeah, the 4 Megs one). Fun stuff to do with that ahead.</p>
 <p>Today I've hacked quite a few things: fix _ASM_SOURCE use (Makefiles
  and code), clean up rnd(4) and kernel build, even help the sparc port;
  reduce the size of the persistent entropy pool, generated manual pages
  and thus distribution; add no_msn flavour to centericq; import new and
  last (branch gcc-3_4 is now closed) gcc and gpc and libtool, start all
  the usual merge and upgrade work (gcc not yet finished); ask cvs(1) to
  not error out if CVSREADONLYFS and it cannot lock var-tags or history;
  apply the OpenSSH and OpenVPN randomness pushback hack to OpenSSL too,
  affecting KEX on SSLv3 and TLSv1, also add my ASN.1 OCTET STREAM hack,
  taken from my vnconfig(8) patch; change ssh(1)/sshd(8) default ciphers
  to prefer secure over fast (these days it's okay like that I suppose);
  bring out a new mirmake; implement $RANDOM (with arc4random(3) until a
  write occured, like in mksh(1)) for sh(1); document ports that disable
  systrace(1) in the INDEX.</p>
 <p>Damn FSF. Libtool is REALLY using /usr/mpkg/bin/bash (note the path)
  as shell, preferring over /bin/sh (eh, what's wrong with mksh?).</p>
 <p>Tonnerre found that to <tt>config = mmap(NULL, st.st_size, PROT_READ
  | PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON, -1, 0UL);</tt> breaks on Limupf... and why. It
  demands use of <tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt> (in contrast to what mmap(2) says,
  on BSD of course). And they want to be compatible, hah!</p>
 <p>Benny thinks he found a bug in perl(1) - my gdb(1) backtrace however
  tells me he'd better look at fseeko() from /usr/lib/libc.so.38.2</p>
 <p>I thought spring was there... but it rained cats and dogs later that
  day. And no new anime episodes to watch &ndash; for weeks!</p>
 <p>Hubert says NetBSD&reg; runs as DomU on Xen3. Me wanna!!!</p>

 <h3 id="e20060329">29.03.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>An meiner Fachhochschule gehen zur Zeit eMails zu einer Aussage des
  Herrn Prof. Dr. Matthias Jarke, Pr&#228;sident der Gesellschaft f&#252;r
  Informatik e.V., im Rahmen eines Interviews zur Er&#246;ffnung des
  Informatikjahrs, herum, die lautet: "Selbstverst&#228;ndlich wird das
  Ausbilduingsniveau von Bachelor-Absolventen deutlich unterhalb des
  bisherigen Diploms liegen, wohl nur knapp oberhalb einer an das Abitur
  angeh&#228;ngten IT-Ausbildung."<br />Ich kann mich der Aussage selber nicht
  ganz anschlie&#223;en, denn eine IT-Ausbildung bei der IHK ist im Gegenteil
  eher <strong>wertvoller</strong> als ein Studium. Zwar lernt man, wie
  ein Kommilitone schrieb, dort keine "design patterns", daf&#252;r mehrfach
  (flach und falsch) Grundlagen von Programmiersprachen, aber wenn man
  seine Ausbildung selbst in die Hand nimmt, Wert auf vieles legt und sich
  engagiert sowie in der ohnehin zur Verf&#252;gung stehenden freien Zeit liest
  oder sich anderweitig weiterbildet (gerne w&#228;hrend Kaffeetrinkens) statt
  die Zeit mit Counter-Strike, Blobby Volley, Browsergames oder sich (bei
  Anderen statt bei der Jugend- und Auszubildendenvertretung!) dar&#252;ber zu
  beschweren, da&#223; man nichts als Rechner schleppen tun mu&#223;/darf. Ich habe
  wenig Ausbildungsrelevantes gelernt und in der Berufsschule eigentlich
  nur Wirtschaft (wu&#223;te ich vorher, war es mir aber sogar wert), habe aber
  viel "nebenbei" gelernt, zum Beispiel, Telex, Kabel ziehen im DVT/HVT,
  ATM, Taktsynchronisation im SDH2000+ Netz, usw. und besonders wertvoll
  war, in einem gro&#223;en Unternehmen immer wieder an anderen Orten zu arbeiten,
  ganze Proze&#223;ketten kennenzulernen, &#252;ber den Tellerrand zu schauen und zu
  sehen, was in der Realit&#228;t <strong>wirklich</strong> ben&#246;tigt wird:
  Skripte und schnelle (aber f&#252;r Kollegen noch verst&#228;ndliche, also auf
  niedrigem Niveau) Frickell&#246;sungen, die, wenn sie nicht mehr tun, halt
  neugeschrieben werden, aber daf&#252;r proze&#223;orientiert, gut dokumentiert
  und in SAP R/3 verbucht. Keine "design patterns", kein Java oder auch
  nur C (naja, bei meiner Abschlu&#223;arbeit habe ich etwas in C geschrieben,
  aber au&#223;er Headern, Deklarationen und Optionen parsen waren das
  vielleicht noch 10 Zeilen Code). Ach ja, und ich habe gelernt, wie schei&#223;e
  MS Office ist und da&#223; Openoffice noch schlechter ist.</p>
 <p>The time of adding entropy exchange to networked d&aelig;mons is now
  over, I suppose. I have added the function to ntpd(8), it is performed
  when an OpenNTPD client talks to it, since we know it sends out random
  data (arc4random(3)) instead of its own xmttime.</p>
 <p>Today I have also completely re-written HTTPS certificate validation
  code for lynx(1) in an attempt to make it work with CAcert.org (a page
  whose certificates contain multiple CNs in the DN). It works so far, I
  have submitted a link to our CVSweb to the lynx-dev mailing list, will
  submit a full patch later so it might get into lynx 2.8.6dev.18 soon.</p>
 <p>I will have to write an ASN.1 OCTET STREAM encoding/decoding module,
  in PEM format, like vnconfig(8) uses for its keys, for openssltool(1),
  for the sake of completeness. Well, later, as time permits.</p>
 <p>Still <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?m=114359728005822">have
  to debug</a> the heartbeat server stuff and MirDNS #3. Also will be as
  time permits.</p>
 <p>Time ought to already have permitted bsiegert@ to commit his pending
  wlog entry, though&#8230;</p>
 <p>I'm inmidst of merging gcc 3.4.6 (final), so HEAD doesn't build now.
  This will be sorted out later as well, though.</p>
 <p>Another thing I'd like to do for the next snapshot is either finally
  rewrite the installer or add an automated Live CD feature to the CDs I
  burn (e.g. for <a href="http://froscon.org/">FROSCON</a>). In addition
  to that, I'm pondering to write an MS-DOS only boot loader (to start a
  kernel loaded via MS-DOS I/O from FAT, NTFS (via ntfsdos.exe), CD-ROM,
  etc. by means of himem.sys and a small relocation/memmove function). I
  still wonder if I can manage to add 'boot -acs...' functionality. This
  beast would of course be written in gas-intel-howto(7) and be built as
  a normal part of MirOS userland (machdep). Kinda loadlin.exe on drugs.
  But this may prove useful later. (Also, our bootloader ought to adhere
  to the multiboot specification in order to make it runnable from grub,
  to bootstrap MirOS from GNU/Linux systems &ndash; can you say Thinkpad
  dear Mr. JanA?).</p>
 <p>The Jolitzens have quite a lot of interesting material on their page
  (e.g. regarding the current BSDs' developers and past). I wonder which
  parts of 386BSD 1.0 made it into MirBSD, what do they think of OpenBSD
  and whether we will get, some time, a kernel architect. (I'd be happy,
  for now, even with a kernel developer; I still plan to teach myself by
  writing herculesfb(4) though. Tho I have to do a gcc 4.1 port as well,
  and do lots of other things.)</p>
 <p>Martin Michlmayr has built, while we're on the topic gcc 4.1, Debian
  with it and documented that; together with hints, he also linked to <a
  href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg01084.html">Take
  some time to read this if you intend to touch any C++ code</a>.</p>
 <p>Kind of another interesting read from my research into Jolix: the <a
  href="http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Torvalds/Finland_period/xenix_microsoft_shortlived_love_affair_with_unix.shtml">story
  on XENIX</a> and <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Torvalds/Finland_period/minix_as_a_precursor_of_linux.shtml">how
  Linus can't code</a> (with proof by <a href="http://liw.iki.fi/liw/texts/linux-anecdotes.html">Lars Wirzenius</a>). It also suggests,
  although whom do you believe, that there were more than just six files
  involved in porting. I'm strangely fascinated by their stories and web
  pages and wonder what to do with it. I doubt they'd work for MirOS tho
  (even if they could play all the kernel design they want).</p>
 <p>Another thing I researched into yesterday was TAOUP; I found that <a
  href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt">Plan 9 did
  invent UTF-8</a> with a funny story. (Why doesn't it surprise me today
  when I see this story is hosted by Markus Kuhn?) I wonder if we simply
  could switch to UTF-8 only operation mode too. I'd like it. No umlauts
  and only basic ISO_646.irv:1991 (that's ASCII for you stupid americans
  aka ANSI_X3.4-1968) for the programmes which don't. That was basically
  what my plans for the "C" locale were. Well, we do export nl_langinfo,
  setlocale etc. as weak symbols for users to override so I suppose I'll
  do the switch. But quietly, so Benny doesn't realise it. (Damn.)</p>
 <p>Ich bin eben &#252;ber einen Vortrag zu Plan 9 gestolpert,
   ein System, das selbst einem Unix-Alteingesessenen
   noch komisch vorkommt. Die meisten Leser hier wird
   freuen, da&#223; man 'ne Maus benutzen soll.<br />

   Vortrag: <a href="http://ftp.belnet.be/mirror/FOSDEM/FOSDEM2006-plan9.avi">http://ftp.belnet.be/mirror/FOSDEM/FOSDEM2006-plan9.avi</a><br />
   Plan 9: <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/plan9/">http://cm.bell-labs.com/plan9/</a> (oder <a href="http://9fans.net/">http://9fans.net/</a>)<br />

   Es gibt auch p9p (Plan 9 from User Space), um das mal
   auf Windows (fr&#252;he Alpha) oder Unix auszuprobieren.<br />

   Den C-Compiler h&#228;tte ich gern, um gcc zu ersetzen, aber
   die Lizenz ist leider auch nicht so wirklich frei.<br />

   Interessant: es ist von Oberon abgeleitet.<br />

   Sehr sch&#246;n auch: <a href="http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/">ETHZ Oberon</a> ist unter einer
   3-clause BSD-style Lizenz freigegeben, also
   quasi "freier gehts nicht".<br />

   Und auf der oben genannten Homepage kann man
   die B&#252;cher "Compilerbau" und "Algorithmen und
   Datenstrukturen" von Prof. Wirth frei herunterladen,
   allerdings die Oberon-Variante, klar. Und nat&#252;rlich
   einen Haufen Oberon-Literatur.<br />

   Ich hatte vor einiger Zeit tats&#228;chlich mal ETHZ Oberon
   nativ installiert, war ganz lustig, aber ich bin dann doch
   nicht so der Mausschubser&#8230;</p>
 <p>I still have DNS trouble which bogus cannot reproduce; his dig shows

 <p>All I wish for now are proper COFF support in the kernel and support

 <p>Today, it's porting kencc and fixing gcc. Duh.</p>
 <p>It was a fucked up day, the weather was bad, people, events were bad
  and this day should be banned...</p>
 <p>... at least I got gcc working.</p>
 <p>I can't seem to either run (kernel) or convert (binutils) a COFF (or
  ECOFF, tried both) executable. Why?</p>
 <p>The solution is probably <em>really</em> to teach 8l ELF... although
  this will be very much work since 8l is not the only linker.</p>
 <p>Benny is still not committing, he rather wants to go to bed. He sent
  out an announcement for the MirOS #8-stale sendmail(8) security update
  though (after I MFC'd it ;).</p>
 <p>Did I mention gcc is a pile of crap? Well, I had to pay for using an
  alpha version of GP &ndash; but the rest <strong>still</strong> is the
  biggest pile of... interesting stuff... we have in the OS.</p>
 <p>Well, kencc doesn't do Propolice, W^X, NXSTACK, NXHEAP etc. (and ELF
  might help with the latter three but I don't know if I'm up to it, and
  Theo won't do it, see above...) so it's probably only going to be used
  as an alternative compiler for those who dare. Security checks (format
  string warnings, __attribute__ stuff etc.) are done with gcc.</p>

 <p>Lately I've been working on a Live CD which is to be built as a part
  of the normal 'dist-q' process. I'm improving continuously; I unveiled
  some bugs in the system during that and am currently rebuilding MirBSD
  at 900 MHz, let's see how long it takes without Ada and GCJ ;)</p>
 <p>My <a href="http://www.cafe-libertad.de/">coffee provider</a> has an
  enhanced set of offers and a new website design, check it out. Today I
  ordered the first time online there, they use "Bankeinzug" and give 2%
  discount on that, even. Cool. Of course, SSL secured (hi entropy).</p>
 <p>More later&#8230;</p>
 <p>&#8230; oops&#8230; it's already this late. TODO: fix kernel msgs (a
  la "swapconf: blah not found"), use rd0a for devices (XXX howto, can I
  preload it into the kernel? I even think so), get rid of the huge time
  consuming MAKEDEV stage in /etc/rc (and don't swapon rd0c *g*), make a
  liveboot (with sercons by high order bits), last bring back X.</p>

 <p>Only today I got notice that Benny is having a one-week trip with no

  and not because he told me. And that despite me trying to impress him,

 <p>I should be working even more on the Live CD but that's it for today
  (after realising that the above patch is not useful unless /boot gains
  ISO 9660 filesystem reading support. (Also it seems to not work.)</p>
 <p>After poking around a bit, I found out this diff indeed does work, I
  just need to use <tt>workdir/usr/mdec/boot</tt> instead of the logical
  <tt>workdir/etc/boot.x86</tt> because the latter contains a mkisofs(8)
  boot info table which forces El Torito boot.</p>
 <p>After poking around <strong>even more</strong> I shockedly found out
  that our <tt>/boot</tt> can actually read (just not 'ls') ISO 9660 CDs
  (when used as hard discs) without further patching.<br />(Now that I'm
  writing this wlog entry, this isn't that surprising &ndash; after all,
  I had patched in &quot;no emulation&quot; boot some time ago.)<br />So
  it can be used, and this patch shall be committed instead. I'll retain
  the early version from above though because it expresses quite some of
  my frustration of today.</p>
 <p>I hacked another bunch into it now&#8230; support for images of hard
  disc drives (with 512 byte sectors instead of 2048), using a specified
  PBR (512-byte) sector (instead of sector 0) or even (hard disc images,
  only, for obvious reasons) MBR partition table support (including that
  userpt stuff). userpt is also supported for CD-ROM images, though it's
  probably not very useful (unless booting e.g. a kernel from wd1). IMHO
  these things are all nice to have, will prove useful and make a unique
  selling (and marketing! hi Daniel) point.</p>
 <p>I'll forget the idea about porting it to GNU/Linux though &ndash; it
  doesn't even have nlist&#8230; how am I supposed to get the offsets of
  my declared-as-global functions within the ELF first-stage boot loader
  now? Some Lunox or Kinderunix guru reading this and want to send me an
  unidiff? (Only -i must work, -I or neither-of-these-specified does not
  need to be used. Partition tables must work, though.)</p>

 <p>There is not much to say today. I'm slowly improving but there are a
  days or times where I need to rest too. At least I fixed the web pages
  (plain text versions) of the licence templates (rcs -kb), added a link
  to the MirOS one from the ISC one (like ealier in the web version) and
  fixed a spelling mistake in ours.</p>
 <p>I got a new user for &#39764;&#29579; and I hope he pays and behaves

 <p>I wonder if it's a good idea to hardcode &#39764;&#29579;&#12398; IP
  address on the live CDs &ndash; but then, MirOS doesn't have more than
  a few hundred users world-wide, NTP intervals are large, and the first
  rdate(8) call doesn't hurt either. (Too bad there's no way to send any

 <p>I've fixed a lot more things in the live CD, created a /cvs snapshot
  and started to change more things (e.g. NFS exporting the live / for a
  method to easily pxeboot other live CDs as live NFSes).</p>
 <p>After Zapata has closed early (mother of the cook fell ill) and we'd
  eaten at the Croatian again, cnuke@ and I are sitting at Jannis' place
  and I tried to pxeboot his IBM X41 (failed due to his Broadcom NIC). I
  think it works, though. Met (honey wine) is tasting good tho. They are
  playing StarCraft (a fun game, but with a weird custom map) and I grin
  in the background, not really knowing what to do (except drinking some
  (admittedly <em>too</em> much) honey wine).</p>
 <p>I found out that one can't post to the GNU Pascal lists via GMane (a
  bad thing since I was advertising for them). I wonder if the other few
  things I noted to the people will be fixed soon (enough).</p>
 <p>gcc 4.1 looks promising but I haven't started porting efforts yet. I
  currently wonder whether I even want to do it before #9 (whose release
  criterium was OpenBSD 3.9 being merged in). I look like I want it, but
  I think I better shan't. We definitively need someone to work on ports
  for the release, too, though. And I'd better fix sparc. (Sadly, my new
  CD-boot and sparc dual-boot don't combine.)</p>
 <p>NetBSD&reg; makefs(8) will hopefully replace mkisofs(8). Even if I'm
  to patch in -boot-info-table support by myself. Schily must die.</p>
 <p>At the moment, I'm building MirOS snapshots (and auto-live-CDs) like
  exemplars of Ford Model T. Trying to improve, I suppose. I don't see a
  lot of rough edges left (though a rewritten boot loader could e.g. say
  which root device the kernel to use).</p>

 <p>At the moment, I am developing on my trustworthy SPARCstation 20 (to
  which a <tt>digital</tt> <i>VT420</i> is attached as console because a
  monitor would be too heavy for me to lift it) since my laptop is fried
  again (PSU, already for a while, and the TFT inverter, for which I try
  to get a replacement). After somehow getting GNU screen to honour flow
  control, it's really not too bad, and I've gotten used to it. Besides,
  amber rocks!</p>
 <p>I don't get any help from people when I post requests to the mailing
  lists. For example: fdialog, the live CD, python, discussion requests,
  like the gcc language stuff, Xen, motd, spamd, IRC, EXEC_ECOFF support
  and bugs, infrastructure/scripts/out-of-date, "mmake clean is broken",
  "/cvs/CVSROOT/*.sh", Bruno Haible, and some more bug stuff. That's why
  I am developing merely for myself at the moment. MirOS #9's release is
  depending on a criterium (merged in current stable version of OpenBSD,
  at the time of releasing), but I probably won't release it without the
  wide char functions working and the SPARC port revived. Furthermore, I
  am diving into MS-DOS&reg; coding&#8230; you've been warned.</p>
 <p>Expect a new version of <a href="/?mksh">mksh</a> to be released RSN
  (like, in a few days). Most important new feature: <tt>~/.mkshrc</tt>,
  by request of a <a href="http://debian.cante.net/">Debian</a> user who
  also prodded me to enhance the manual page mksh(1) &ndash; it includes
  the latest fixes by OpenBSD too though. I also cvs admin -b'd portable
  mksh's extensions (four files) into -rHEAD so that people can test any
  mksh extension development directly (without the Attic).</p>
 <p>Do not expect the website to change much, or be updated (probably as
  calendars don't get updated by anyone *sigh*). I will work a little on
  improving stuff found during more extensive testing of the live CD and
  portable mksh in the next days and then look where my current interest
  is tending towards. Watch source-ch^W^Wmiros-changes@ for info. It may
  look as if it has turned back into MirBSD.</p>
 <p>Stability issues on the server still have not been sorted out, and I
  am out of ideas. But we can't easily do without, either.</p>
 <p>Finally, a word: while it may be hidden from the mainstream, and its
  activity not be reflected on the web site, mailing lists, freshmeat, a
  trade fair, symlink, OSnews, D&aelig;monnews, allbsd, undeadly, etc. I
  don't see it sinking into oblivion. But I am going to focus on, merely
  (until I get responses like the recent mksh discussion), developing on
  what I think is needed. This may include a framebuffer device and/or X
  server/module for a 20+ year old graphics card. I'm, also, looking for
  employment and would kind of like to &quot;bring in&quot; MirOS, but I
  don't think that's going to happen. At least not now &ndash; even some
  finnish person who can't even program sprintf(3) made a job out of it.
  (He didn't discover the bug in that function for years, either.)</p>

 <p>This wlog entry is probably not read by many. Thanks to gecko2, I've
  got set up at least an AnonCVS mirror (anoncvs@unixforge.de:/cvs IPv4,
  anoncvs@hephaistos.tb.as8758.net:/cvs IPv6), and remotely possibly, <a
  href="http://users.unixforge.de/~tglaser/?wlog-8">this page</a> might,
  with a few broken links/images, be visible.</p>
 <p>I'm &quot;developing&quot; on NWT at the moment &ndash; a Mitac 4023
  notebook (Cyrix 486DLC with 33, 66 or 80 MHz, no idea; 12 MiB RAM (and
  a custom kernel); a 450 MB HDD replacing the old 110 MB one and, yuck,
  french keyboard (slightly remapped) in US mode of course). I've put an
  almost usable filesystem on the disc (the contents of bsd.rd's mr.fs),
  added a few programmes and a dmassage'd GENERIC minus what I don't use
  on the book (like ext2fs), that works. Its display is okay, (D)STN LCD
  in VGA greyscale, and I am already getting used to that damn keyboard,
  but more than less(1) and ssh(1) isn't feasible. Not really good to do
  any developing work.</p>
 <p>The server situation is desastrous. I'm thinking of giving up having
  an own dedicated server and just paying a few people for the services,
  that is, AnonCVS, AnonRSYNC, website + CVSweb, name and mail server. I
  think I already know with whom and how to do it, I but need to get out
  of the contract and, beforehand, back the data. Strato at first tried,
  I was impressed, to help but now runs a "let's ignore him" strategy. I
  can understand that, after all I'm only paying 19.90 &euro; per month,
  but nevertheless they're denying me service.</p>
 <p>Oh, by the way &ndash; I got odem back working, just its display is,
  still, a mess: the green part doesn't show. Headaches.</p>
 <p>Benny has been helping with ports and the interim (excuse for a) web
  site^Wpages, thanks.</p>
 <p>Hiroki Sato managed not only to get production IPv6 address space to
  keep *.allbsd.org reachable but also fixed the mirroring problem, so I
  think we have two working anoncvs mirrors at the moment. Again, thanks
  to all the people involved with BSD or not even (e.g. a certain Debian
  Developer springs to mind) who are helping to ensure the MirOS Project
  doesn't continue to exist in oblivion but is still discoverable by the
  general public.</p>

 <p>Not that this is going to be read... congratulations to a few mates,
  celebrate your birthday, may you already be able to walk on four legs,
  being able to walk on two comes the day after.</p>
 <p>Benny's going to rewrite the website's content this summer (simplify
  but not change the layout); mksh R27c, mirmake, cksum and mircpio have
  had new releases; there have been a lot of minor changes; base is in a
  good state and ports work on Mac again (including mc).</p>
 <p>Debian's cvs(1) must've smoked something weird&#8230; it formats the
  RCS ID timestamps yyyy-mm-dd instead of yyyy/mm/dd. For now instructed
  gecko2 to place a hand-crafted cvs binary from MirOS sources (plus Han
  Boetes' arc4random for GNU/Linux and hand-compiled libc ndbm) into the
  anoncvs home directory on hephaistos. That box is also ntp.mirbsd.org,
  IPv4, even though not running OpenNTPD, because the live CD gives some
  unfriendly messages at startup otherwise. (To prevent a phk-dlink like
  disaster, he's been informed though. I hope something else comes up in
  short terms, though.)</p>
 <p>It could rain a little less.</p>

 <p>Waldemar Brodkorb, a friend (and beer drinking mate) of mine, has <a
  href="http://openbsd-geek.de/archives/223-OpenWrt-Project.html">had to
  leave the OpenWRT project</a> in order to fork. Sounds familiar? Well,
  I am now a full FreeWRT developer as well. Just wanted to tell you, so
  you don't worry &ndash; I won't lessen working on MirOS. Rather, I may
  be able to impregnate the GNU-dominated world of embedded systems with
  a little BSD spirit. The reasons for him leaving have been outlined <a
  href="http://www.openbsd-geek.de/archives/224-An-open-letter-to-the-OpenWrt-community.html">in
  his blog</a> as well.</p>

 <p>This is available under <a href="http://miros.unixforge.de/?wlog-8">
  http://miros.unixforge.de/?wlog-8</a></p>
 <p>MirOS now has I18N support. Totally untested. Please test whether it
  "works", the manual pages don't disagree with SUSv3 and ISO 9899:1999,
  the code adheres to the manual pages, the code is bug-free; write some
  more (missing) manual pages, etc.</p>

 <p>Forking seems to be common against my Verpeiler mates; first wbx and
  OpenWRT/FreeWRT (and he's done an OpenBSD/WbxBSD split too, with MirOS
  stuff inside), after &ndash; of course &ndash; me OpenBSD/MirBSD; now,
  <a href="http://blog.annulator.de/">Angelo Laub</a> (yeah, that MacOSX
  worm guy is a drinking mate of mine) does an OpenBSD fork as well (or,
  at least he's asked me for help).</p>
 <p>Benny is never there when you need him except later, but the old and
  new fxp(4) codes both work on HERC, so what, I leave in the new "old",
  he'll test on monday, and I'll go snapshot now. Expect some surprises,
  if everything goes well.</p>
 <p>TGEN and Tonnerre are interesting people. Sad they're usually quiet,
  in <a href="/?irc">IRC</a> (#bsd).</p>

 <p>I finally got maou rebooted, I'm currently backing it up via serial,
  yes, 56kbps, console ;) and have already found a person who'll take it
  over so I'll be relieved of the payment soon. I'll just rent space, at
  gecko2s box for now.</p>
 <p>gdb doesn't work with the J or Z malloc.conf(5) options&#8230;</p>
 <p>Found some more annoying bugs in libc/i18n, should be all fixed now.
  Also, I removed a few unused programmes and libraries; no need for the
  year-old unmaintained and unaudited stuff to linger around.</p>
 <p>The tries to update libncurses failed&#8230; see the commit message,
  if you really want to know more.</p>

 <p>There was a soccer competition at my university &ndash; although ex,
  I participiated, and it wasn't even me playing badly that we lost, but
  the others (Economists, Mecha builders etc.) brought some professional
  players so we didn't stand a chance. 4:0 4:0 1:1 and out.</p>
 <p>I didn't have much success trying to trace down my LCD issues. It is
  in both cases a low-voltage differential thingie with digital (serial)
  transfer, so no idea why green is missing. Looks like I have invest my
  first FreeWRT wage into an LCD, or rather, a laptop &ndash; or ask the
  local Arab whether he's got an idea.</p>
 <p>Still haven't done much for FreeWRT, but tomorrow, wbx@ will show me
  how the system &quot;usually&quot; works under GNU/Lunox. Also, I will
  start by doing an mksh port, let him check it and then try a 'svn ci',
  in the hope I didn't do anything wrong, to test that.</p>
 <p>Oh, the surprises are unveiled I guess. I've just cross-built a (not
  yet tested) GENERIC for sparc. More surprises to come.</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060611">11.06.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>I had some initial <a href="https://www.freewrt.org/">FreeWRT</a> ci
  with wbx@ today and better would ask gmane and marc guys for archives,
  before it's too late.</p>
 <p>I built a sparc bsd.net kernel (with elf2aout(1) on i386!) but can't
  netboot it... it's been too long since I did that (&gt;2 years).</p>
 <p>I had four Altbier (beer) and some Julishka and Krushkovac today, so
  I'm not really coherent... but it tastes delicious!</p>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060612">12.06.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>Not much success with sparc&#8230;&ndash; as if there were some bug,
  deep hidden inside the kernel. I will try building a #9-beta kernel on
  the box (natively on #7-stable) then. UPDATE: Didn't make a difference
  either. Can please <b>someone</b> tell me why it freezes in midst of a
  printf(9)?</p>
 <p>Not much success with &quot;real life&quot; either and it's just too
  hot for real FreeWRT work. Also, I ought to add .gz read/write support
  to config(8) -e&#8230;</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060615">15.06.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>Yay! My laptop works again. Did cost me 50 &euro; and lots of sweat,
  though.</p>
 <p>As we have had a sendm&uuml;ll update, I am to issue a first #9-beta
  snapshot (i386) to the people. It already comes with brk malloc, non-g
  libs, etc. as it's resembling the upcoming release. There is still few
  stuff missing:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Send out an eMail &quot;status report&quot;</li>
  <li>Update ports: rsync, unzip, zip, mplayer, gmake, bison, maybe bind
   (assigned to bsiegert@)</li>
  <li>Update SSH and similar stuff</li>
  <li>Have a look at if there's a newer GNU Pascal (probably not)</li>
  <li>Fix sparc</li>
  <li>Add gzio support to config(8) -e</li>
  <li>&#8230;</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Markus Rosellen is sponsoring us a show-case Compaq Proliant 800 for
  the <a href="http://www.froscon.org/">FROSCON</a>, which to install is
  bsiegert@'s task, again. Thanks!</p>
 <p>pkgsrc&reg; on Interix sounds funny, MirPorts is easier or better in
  some regards, but lacks others. It's not used at the moment anyway.</p>
 <p>Why must it always be so hot even while raining?</p>
</div>

<div class="wlentry">
 <h3 id="e20060616">16.06.2006 by tg@</h3>
 <p>A shitty day. The weather was superb. Sunny, dry and not too hot due
  to the still resident rain remnants from yesterday, not sticky either.
  Yet I had noone to kill time with except my trusty laptop and sparc. I
  &quot;forgot&quot; to breakfast either, and apparently I'm too late to
  go shopping now as well. Doesn't matter though, I keep a few things at
  home for emergency hunger cases ;) and had bought a lot of beer 2 days
  ago because yesterday was national holiday anyway. I might have diner,
  no idea with whom though, in the city later.</p>
 <p style="margin-bottom:0px;">On the western frontier&#8230; I've built
  myself a sparc kernel which does now boot (some delay(9) calls added),
  but doesn't cleanly execute any binary, save the following one:</p>
 <div style="border:4px ridge blue; margin:0px 24px 0px 24px; padding:12px;">
  <pre>
	#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

	main()
	{
		int fd;

		printf("Hello, World!\n");
		fflush(stdout);
		if ((fd = open("/dev/console", O_RDWR)) == -1) {
			fprintf(stderr, "cannot open /dev/console\n");
		} else {
			write(fd, "This is the console!\n",
			    strlen("This is the console!\n"));
			close(fd);
		}
		for (fd = 0; fd &lt; 10; ++fd) {
			printf(".");
			fflush(stdout);
			sleep(2);
		}
		printf("\nexiting...\n");
		fflush(stdout);
		fflush(stderr);
		return 0;
	}
  </pre>
 </div><p style="margin-top:0px;">This includes finding and fixing a few
  bugs in libc, building and installing csu, building and installing the
  static libc stuff, first, though. And I only get this line: &quot;This
  is the console!&quot; (Afterwards, I end up in ddb(4) which is sort of
  cool, really, as I can type &quot;machine prom&quot; to cleanly finish
  off the infantile operating system.</p>
 <p>Due to the many recent fixes, I must build and release a snapshot to
  the public first though, afterwards I might tend to the pending issues
  (such as gzio support for config(8) and sparc userland). And of course
  the status report eMail.</p>
</div>

<p id="eof">Good luck, have fun, take care etc.pp</p>
