 <p>I'm committing this as 2006-06-25, but actually, I haven't slept for
  <em>more</em> than 31 (thirty-one) hours now, so it could very well be
  under 2006-06-24. I'm going to sleep now, but not without releasing an
  ISO of MirOS #9semel on BitTorrent.</p>
 <p>There's now a new <a href="/?bt">BitTorrent info page</a> not linked
  anywhere except from the tracker (and here). It ought to describe what
  the torrent will give you.</p>

 <p>On a rainy day, I'm continuing to hack on sparc again. I haven't yet
  found why dynamic linking breaks, just how to break it even more, plus
  without a working gdb there isn't much I can do. On the other hand, my
  kernel didn't panic yet, so I'm going to make it a static arch for now
  and get back to ld.so(1) support later.</p>
 <p>On a related side note, we're currently developing #9-stable in HEAD
  and will branch that later. I want a #9bis to be out both as soon as I
  can and sparc works reliably, and with as few differences from #9semel
  as possible. This also gives us a chance to polish ports and docs.</p>
 <p>Benny is moving homes at the moment.</p>
 <p>Oh, and FrOSCon was a full success, best event I ever attended. I've
  intended to write more here but I'm still done with.</p>
 <p>Which &lt;censored/&gt; set the maximum datasize for sparc to a mere
  128 MiB, in contrast to i386's 1 GiB? Bumped to 320 MiB in order to be
  able to build gcc&#8230; kernel really seems stable now, compiled both
  cross and natively.</p>

 <p>I've built MirOS (base and gcc) entirely on the sparc and have fixed
  the GNU Debugger in the progress as well. I'll have to change a little
  code in order to silent gcc, but that's not much left.</p>
 <p>In order to fix a few security leaks, I updated libpng and freetype2
  as well. I yet have to re-build the entire X-Windowing system in order
  to test whether this actually does not break anything. Neither has the
  XFree86 environment been ported to the new sparc system.</p>
 <p>After the bump of autoconf to version 2.60 everything must be tested
  and libtool ought to be bumped as well.</p>
 <p>Finally, I must make sure that distrib/ works on sparc and release a
  first snapshot &ndash; optimally as live-cd :) but I'm not going there
  yet.</p>

 <p>My sparc has just gone NOPIC=no, i.e. builds ld.so(1) and shared lib
  stuff just fine. bsiegert@ isn't (sadly) reachable by phone though, so
  I continued to hack on autoconf/libtool, regenerated all the stuff and
  then threw in the new perl. Now I've got to, after refining a few more
  code pieces, check if everything (including X11) builds on i386 again.
  On sparc, I've got to take what I've got, build the distrib/ stuff and
  a snapshot in order to install that on another hard disc.</p>
 <p>I think -rHEAD is in pretty good shape, I'll upgrade as much as I'll
  be able to do in the next days, try to get a stable sparc development,
  build and test environment, and fix everything outstanding in the base
  system. Regarding ports, I won't do much but leave that to Benny, I'll
  do base system in the meanwhile and hope he fixes these ports which do
  need it. (autoconf 2.60 is in, but I don't think there's any fallout.)
  Thus, we can (tentatively) release #9bis in two or three weeks.</p>
 <p>It's family weekend for me, don't expect too many commits. Also, I'm
  in that "computers suck" mood again but the weather (too hot) keeps me
  from giving in to it.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the <a href="http://www.netzladen.org/">Netzladen
  (usual place)</a> has got me back&#8230; at least for drinking some <a
  href="http://www.cafe-libertad.de/">fine Met (honey wine)</a>.</p>
 <p>Benny, when are you going to commit that full-japanese wlog entry of
  yours?</p>

<p id="eof">Good luck, have fun, take care etc.pp</p>
