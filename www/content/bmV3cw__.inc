<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>06.04.2006<br />The Ada and GCJ compilers are no longer delivered with
	MirOS-current. Users who require them must now build these drivers
	manually by changing <tt>/etc/make.cfg</tt> and building the "gcc"
	module. Note: GNAT (the Ada compiler of GCC) requires itself to be
	built (you can pull it from an older snapshot or #8-stable).</li>

<li>29.03.2006<br />We've added a new server to the Freeforge IRC network,
	<tt>herc.66h.42h.de</tt> Port 6668 (SSL), 6667 and 6666 (non-SSL).
	You can either directly connect to that server or the round-robin,
	<tt>irc.66h.42h.de</tt> (or <tt>irc4.66h.42h.de</tt> for IPv4-only
	or <tt>irc6.66h.42h.de</tt> for IPv6-only connections). Note: this
	server does have IPv6 connectivity, however it's only a SixXS over
	ADSL (consumer line) connection, so don't overload it.</li>

<li>27.03.2006<br />In case you have acquired a MirOS CD-ROM "FOSDEM 2006"
	edition please verify the checksums of the data on the CD. Some of
	the CDs we distributed at FOSDEM were burned from a bad ISO.</li>
