<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>02.08.2005<br />
	MirOS hasn't stopped, it's just progressing slowly because current
	development is progressing in rather big steps. There is a status,
	mirror and "all-in-one overview" page now which we will keep up to
	date if no other one. There are also some hardware issues to solve
	(such as a broken Socket 7 fan, and a non-working coffee machine),
	but we will continue development and fighting lobbyism, politician
	nonsense etc.<br />mksh R24 has been released some time ago and is
	the first one who actually made it into Debian testing, hooray!</li>

<li>06.07.2005<br />
	The European Parliament has finally stopped patents on algorithms,
	data structures and business models. MirOS has gained speed, USB 2
	support and probably a few other things, among more stability. The
	MirPorts Framework is undergoing an infrastructural change of deep
	impact; we will keep you informed. The MirWiki is about to be shut
	down end of July, 2005; content will be merged back into the MirOS
	website (www module); this is due to lack of interest.</li>

<li>26.05.2005<br />
	<a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirbsdKsh">mksh</a> R22 is formally
	released; this is the latest version of our portable shell sources
	which we consider stable.<br />Most in-tree issues for the release
	have settled down; there is still some work to do in the upgrading
	third-party stuff (gcc, binutils, gdb, lynx) development. It's not
	adviced to download the current sources and compile it yourself at
	this time. (Update: R22c, some portability fixes.)</li>

<li>05.05.2005<br />
	K7 PowerNow support has been greatly revamped, the PST used can be
	chosen at UKC time now. A third release candidate should have been
	uploaded but could not due to a server defect. The main CVS server
	was updated with MirOS #8 RC3, and we use the new commitid feature
	of GNU CVS 1.12.12 extensively now. Expect a fourth candidate seen
	on the BitTorrent servers soon.</li>

<li>03.05.2005<br />
	Yesterday's Snapshot comes with a broken httpd(8) that is fixed in
	HEAD, and a broken gij(1) for which I cannot imagine a fix. Please
	help investigating if you know GCJ.</li>
