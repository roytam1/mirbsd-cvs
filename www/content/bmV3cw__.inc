<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>20.08.2005<br />
	The MirPorts Framework now installs into <tt>/usr/mpkg</tt> on all
	platforms by default. This improves coexistence with other porting
	frameworks, such as the OpenBSD Ports Tree; simplifies cleaning up
	by removal of all installed packages; provides a consistent, among
	all platforms, interface; leaves <tt>/usr/local</tt> to the admin.
	Of course, this means, reinstallation is necessary.<br />Please to
	be keeping in mind that most ports (that were using libtool) still
	need to be updated.</li>

<li>09.08.2005<br />
	The <a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/">MirWiki</a> is read-only, for
	a transition phase. The content will be merged into the main page,
	as time permits. After that, it will be shut down entirely.</li>

<li>02.08.2005<br />
	MirOS hasn't stopped, it's just progressing slowly because current
	development is progressing in rather big steps. There is a status,
	mirror and "all-in-one overview" page now which we will keep up to
	date if no other one. There are also some hardware issues to solve
	(such as a broken Socket 7 fan, and a non-working coffee machine),
	but we will continue development and fighting lobbyism, politician
	nonsense etc.<br />mksh R24 has been released some time ago and is
	the first one who actually made it into Debian testing, hooray!</li>
