<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>20.03.2005<br />
	We have updated our XFree86&trade; to the recently released 4.5.0,
	with only minor breakage along the way. Also, MirPorts are getting
	fixed by bsiegert@ after the transition to the new CVS repository.
	This means the next snapshot will rock even more, especially since
	X11 is built using systrace now, too; we'd appreciate if our users
	were going to test them hard and help fixing problems.<br />As for
	the website design changes: it's not yet finished, but we're still
	waiting for delivery of the new images. Stay tuned.</li>

<li>19.03.2005<br />
	<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86&trade;</a> 4.5 joined us
	in the tree; it's currently in the process of being ported.</li>

<li>13.03.2005<br />
	We've reopened the webpages, after the Wiki came back earlier. The
	problems about software patents aren't finished, either. Good news
	is that Plan 9's ditroff is under an acceptable licence.<br />ncvs
	migration of <tt>src</tt> is pretty much complete, except Lynx (an
	upstream update is expected); gcc isn't started yet and X11 really
	depends upon when <a href="http://xfree86.org/">XFree86&trade;</a>
	is about to be released.</li>
