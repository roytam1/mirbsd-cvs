<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>05.07.2006<br />As you see above, this page is really orphaned. We did
	warn you. FYI, the former mirsolutions server is no longer. gecko2
	hosts (for money&#8230;) the box behind www.mirbsd.org now. waldis
	Zope is still operational and helps a lot.</li>

<li>23.04.2006<br />There might be a service outage on mirsolutions.de and
	mirbsd.org soonish. We will try to prepare backup NS/MX in advance
	and point the mirbsd.de redirector you should be using for any web
	stuff anyway to a working mirror. On some unrelated news, the live
	CD which will be distributed at LinuxTag 2006 is already up on the
	<a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent tracker</a>, I
	however recommend to get the CD there anyway if you can make it as
	we've revived the cool LinuxTag 2004 cover by Wokmann. The current
	live CD still does not have automatic serial console recognisation
	in the fancy boot manager, though.</li>

<li>11.04.2006<br />On <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent
	</a> there is a new snapshot available, which, for the first time,
	is a combined Live/Install CD. From now on, you can also cat(1) or
	dd(1) the ISO (either cdrom8.iso or the live/install ISO) onto the
	hard disc and just load it from there, without installboot(8/i386)
	needing to be run (it's included on the CD already). There are few
	bugs in this snapshot, some of which I already know and fixed. I'd
	appreciate everyone to test it and send in results, whether failed
	or succeeded (especially if there is a regression e.g. regarding a
	normal installation). Thanks!</li>

<li>older news:<br />Please read the <a href="/?irc">FreeForge IRC network
	information</a> as well.</li>

<li>27.03.2006<br />In case you have acquired a MirOS CD-ROM "FOSDEM 2006"
	edition please verify the checksums of the data on the CD. Some of
	the CDs we distributed at FOSDEM were burned from a bad ISO.</li>
