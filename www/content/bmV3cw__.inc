<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>15.01.2006<br />We are having problems with the domain hosters, please
	stand by, we will solve them.<br />The 2006-01-13 snapshot has now
	been published, although some data (www, domains, ssh public keys,
	HTML man pags) are only correct in the HEAD revision.</li>

<li>03.01.2006<br />Several minor fixes in ports, roff2htm and other parts
	of the system.<br />Do not hardcode MirOS mirrors, use the generic
	redirection (mirbsd.de/mirbsd.org) instead, as they'll change.</li>

<li>30.12.2005<br />A bugfix in the current development version leads to a
	working implementation of the &quot;some shared library depends on
	another shared library&quot; scenario. Whether it's now officially
	supported is still to decide (don't depend on it), but a candidate
	for MFC, definitively.<br />Several publication media have written
	off each other. After waking up we were like, "WTF we had released
	a <tt>MirOS XP</tt>?" and cleaned up with explanations.</li>

<li>29.12.2005<br /><a href="/?ann-8">Public MirOS #8 Release Announcement
	(HTML version)</a> crafted.<br />MirPorts now contains a provision
	for properly locating X11 application defaults.<br />MirOS Project
	will attend <a href="http://www.froscon.org/">FROSCON</a>, sponsor
	a BSD room (for all BSDs). At 22C3, DragonFly BSD people confirmed
	that they actually exist (and will attend FROSCON).</li>

<li>18.12.2005<br />First public development snapshot of tg@'s fork of the
	sirc IRC client, <a href="http://www.66h.42h.de/bsd/mirsirc-20051218.tgz">MirSirc</a>,
	released for peer review (relative to <tt>/usr/local</tt>).<br />A
	lot of pending fixes for the build of the whole system was revised
