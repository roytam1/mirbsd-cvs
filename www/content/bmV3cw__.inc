<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>30.04.2005<br />
	The current development version <em>really</em> fixes <em>all</em>
	known C++ issues, as well as enables GCJ (and libjava) to build. I
	also have successfully built Sun's JDK/JRE 1.4.2 and QT3. The work
	(as far as I can see with my limited knowledge).</p>

<li>28.04.2005<br />
	MirOS #8 RC1 is out, for general testing. Please update bsd.own.mk
	to src/share/mk/bsd.own.mk,v 1.8 because otherwise some programmes
	fail to compile correctly. Installation documentation is currently
	being written, system documentation being updated (so please, bear
	with us or, better, send in patches or suggestions).</li>

<li>25.04.2005<br />
	MirOS-current (no snapshot yet) fixes the C++ problems, it's now a
	fully supported programming language (leaving only GCJ open for my
	desires &ndash; that's the reason gcc is built after X11 by a make
	dist, by the way). It also contains some other minor yet important
	fixes, but there's still an update of a component pending before a
	new snapshot can be released.</li>
