<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>03.10.2005<br />After about 2&frac12; years, our first mirror (in USA)
	goes offline. Thanks to bsdadvocacy.org for hosting us so long, at
	the very beginning even though the OpenBSD team disapproved.<br />
	Also, the etherkiller.de mirror disappeared, and the tamu.edu was,
	IIRC, taken offline some time ago. This means, at the moment there
	is only one, central, place to retrieve MirOS BSD (in Germany): <a
	href="https://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de:445/">mirbsd.mirsolutions.de</a><br />
	There has been some further work ongoing related to both the ports
	stuff (infrastructure fixes and port updates) and libc (it builds,
	but this is only a small step towards both I18N and unbreaking the
	current CVS HEAD).</li>

<li>23.09.2005<br />New MirMake; MirPorts work again on Darwin; I18N/UTF-8
	work on libc has been started.</li>

<li>18.09.2005<br />A new version of MirMake has been released; test it on
	as many platforms as you can please.<br />Development slowed down,
	mostly due to influenza, also studying work increases. Sorry.</li>

<li>12.09.2005<br />
	The MirPorts Framework now can be installed as user too. The newly
	written infrastructure is active; Support for Darwin, OpenBSD and,
	eventually, Interix will make it into the framework the next days.
	Along with this, new versions of the Mir* tools have been released
	(gzsig'd as usual).</li>
