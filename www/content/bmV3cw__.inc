<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>05.02.2005<br />
	The (final) new CVS repository has been started; the modules "www"
	and "contrib" have been fully merged over, "src" and "X11" started
	and "gcc" and "ports" will follow. <a href="/cvs.cgi/">CVSweb</a>,
	still lacking adequate functionality to directly display ChangeLog
	links (we work around it now), has been updated and enhanced.</li>

<li>22.01.2005<br />
	We're almost through with the new directory structure, CVS and GCC
	versions and various stages of merging and fixing. SSH still dumps
	core after exiting (forced by ProPolice), but there will be a peek
	into the new technology available for download later, which closes
	our work on ncvs I and leads to opening ncvs II back at herc.</li>

<li>07.01.2005<br />
	Benny has formally released <a href="/?ann-7">#7quinquies</a> for
	the i386 platform (build sparc from #7-stable source after having
	installed #7quater) and Thorsten fixed up the MirOS BSD kernel to
	build with gcc 3.4 and merged much more code into ncvs.</li>

<li>05.01.2005<br />
	Happy new year to all MirOS users! We've just returned from 21C3,
	the first MirHackathon's location, where we successfully built a
	macppc system cross. This night, tg@ has also successfully built
	a local gcc 3.4 (still without ProPolice, but progressing fast).
	An exciting number of new features <b>and</b> bug fixes is being
	made in the different (and confusing) CVS branches. Stay tuned!</li>
