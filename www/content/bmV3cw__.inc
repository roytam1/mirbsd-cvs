<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>24.01.2006<br />Progress is being made both in ports as in base. A new
	snapshot is scheduled to be uploaded in a few days also fixing the
	HTML problems with the online manual pages.</li>

<li>20.01.2006<br />Some of the domain issues have been solved, and the #1
	well-known mirror (mirbsd.mirsolutions.de) is back up and running,
	although only with a kludge. Expect mirbsd.org to point to the new
	master server soonish, and some overhaul of the website content to
	reflect the changes. The old CVS repositories have been frozen and
	published as a cpio-ball (all three together); there will be zero,
	really no commits at all any more to ocvs.<br />The G**gle Ads are
	gone from the website and will cease to exist in the manual pages,
	too. They closed my account for supposed abuse which I (tg@) can't
	have done (only installed opera afterwards to login and check if I
	can see something in the logs, couldn't login already), right when
	the first payment was about to be issued (accumulated some 100 USD
	in over 10 months), and do not react on my enquiring eMail at all.
	This just sucks, and they do owe me that money.<br />Check out the
	<a href="/?wlog-8">web log</a> too, it's a bit more active than in
	the past (not much though).<br />MirSirc has been updated in ports
	relative to the public preview, use that. A new <tt>/cvs</tt> cpio
	ball will be published quite soon, too.</li>
