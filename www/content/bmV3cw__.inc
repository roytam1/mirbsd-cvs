<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>05.12.2005<br />Updated GNU CVS to 1.12.13; rewrote the scripts we use
	in /cvs/CVSROOT/ to generate changelogs and mails (maybe add later
	support for changesets in cvsweb). Shrink source tree (by removing
	unused tags and cleaning up the Attic). Re-enable bootfloppy.</li>

<li>04.12.2005<br />mksh R26 and new MirMake and CPIO versions are out and
	change big thing. The source tree has been fully merged; snapshots
	will be built again soon, preparations started.</li>

<li>20.11.2005<br />mksh R25b has been released, with support for MirOS #7
	and (new) Cygwin. The current versions of gcc-3.4 (stable) and gpc
	(GNU Pascal) have been imported, and bugs are being fixed. Work on
	ports has stabilised, the new infrastructure is ready.</li>
