<h1>Current MirOS News</h1><ul>

<li>13.03.2005<br />
	We've reopened the webpages, after the Wiki came back earlier. The
	problems about software patents aren't finished, either. Good news
	is that Plan 9's ditroff is under an acceptable licence.<br />ncvs
	migration of <tt>src</tt> is pretty much complete, except Lynx (an
	upstream update is expected); gcc isn't started yet and X11 really
	depends upon when <a href="http://xfree86.org/">XFree86&trade;</a>
	is about to be released.</li>

<li>06.03.2005<br />
	<tt>mirbsd.org</tt> has been freed and saved from the hands of the
	evil OpenBSD force who announced in a primitive video that they'll
	put some new pictures on there. It has since been sponsored to the
	MirOS Project (but, similar to <tt>mirbsd.de</tt>, does not belong
	to a project member). Both second-level domains are content-filled
	from a Zope system run by the owner of <tt>mirbsd.de</tt>, where 2
	project members are content admins.</li>

<li>28.02.2005<br />
	We're back from FOSDEM. MirPorts work on Mac OSX now, but only for
	ports <b>without</b> a <tt>PFRAG.shared</tt>!<br />Update 02.03.05
	<br />There is basic support for <tt>PFRAG.dylib</tt> in place, so
	Midnight Commander (including libglib, autoconf 2.13 and 2.59, and
	help2man, works &ndash; this includes MirLibtool)!</li>

<li>05.02.2005<br />
	The (final) new CVS repository has been started; the modules "www"
	and "contrib" have been fully merged over, "src" and "X11" started
	and "gcc" and "ports" will follow. <a href="/cvs.cgi/">CVSweb</a>,
	still lacking adequate functionality to directly display ChangeLog
	links (we work around it now), has been updated and enhanced.</li>
