<h3>Old News</h3>
<p><a href="#newsend">Skip to News bottom</a></p><ul>

<li>22.03.2005<br />
	The MirOS Project has obtained a new logo to identify the project.
	It will look quite familiar for a couple of you, but we obtained a
	full permit to identify it with anything MirBSD&trade;.<br />Also,
	the GNU Compiler Collection 3.4.4 has made it into the source tree
	and is being ported; XFree86&reg; has been contacted.</li>

<li>20.03.2005<br />
	We have updated our XFree86&trade; to the recently released 4.5.0,
	with only minor breakage along the way. Also, MirPorts are getting
	fixed by bsiegert@ after the transition to the new CVS repository.
	This means the next snapshot will rock even more, especially since
	X11 is built using systrace now, too; we'd appreciate if our users
	were going to test them hard and help fixing problems.<br />As for
	the website design changes: it's not yet finished, but we're still
	waiting for delivery of the new images. Stay tuned.</li>

<li>19.03.2005<br />
	<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86&trade;</a> 4.5 joined us
	in the tree; it's currently in the process of being ported.</li>

<li>13.03.2005<br />
	We've reopened the webpages, after the Wiki came back earlier. The
	problems about software patents aren't finished, either. Good news
	is that Plan 9's ditroff is under an acceptable licence.<br />ncvs
	migration of <tt>src</tt> is pretty much complete, except Lynx (an
	upstream update is expected); gcc isn't started yet and X11 really
	depends upon when <a href="http://xfree86.org/">XFree86&trade;</a>
	is about to be released.</li>

<li>06.03.2005<br />
	<tt>mirbsd.org</tt> has been freed and saved from the hands of the
	evil OpenBSD force who announced in a primitive video that they'll
	put some new pictures on there. It has since been sponsored to the
	MirOS Project (but, similar to <tt>mirbsd.de</tt>, does not belong
	to a project member). Both second-level domains are content-filled
	from a Zope system run by the owner of <tt>mirbsd.de</tt>, where 2
	project members are content admins.</li>

<li>28.02.2005<br />
	We're back from FOSDEM. MirPorts work on Mac OSX now, but only for
	ports <b>without</b> a <tt>PFRAG.shared</tt>!<br />Update 02.03.05
	<br />There is basic support for <tt>PFRAG.dylib</tt> in place, so
	Midnight Commander (including libglib, autoconf 2.13 and 2.59, and
	help2man, works &ndash; this includes MirLibtool)!</li>

<li>05.02.2005<br />
	The (final) new CVS repository has been started; the modules "www"
	and "contrib" have been fully merged over, "src" and "X11" started
	and "gcc" and "ports" will follow. <a href="/cvs.cgi/">CVSweb</a>,
	still lacking adequate functionality to directly display ChangeLog
	links (we work around it now), has been updated and enhanced.</li>

<li>22.01.2005<br />
	We're almost through with the new directory structure, CVS and GCC
	versions and various stages of merging and fixing. SSH still dumps
	core after exiting (forced by ProPolice), but there will be a peek
	into the new technology available for download later, which closes
	our work on ncvs I and leads to opening ncvs II back at herc.</li>

<li>07.01.2005<br />
	Benny has formally released <a href="/?ann-7">#7quinquies</a> for
	the i386 platform (build sparc from #7-stable source after having
	installed #7quater) and Thorsten fixed up the MirOS BSD kernel to
	build with gcc 3.4 and merged much more code into ncvs.</li>

<li>05.01.2005<br />
	Happy new year to all MirOS users! We've just returned from 21C3,
	the first MirHackathon's location, where we successfully built a
	macppc system cross. This night, tg@ has also successfully built
	a local gcc 3.4 (still without ProPolice, but progressing fast).
	An exciting number of new features <b>and</b> bug fixes is being
	made in the different (and confusing) CVS branches. Stay tuned!</li>

<li>03.12.2004<br />
	CVS 1.12.10 has entered HEAD and replaces CVS 1.11.1p1 which has
	done well for ages. (Let me repeat it again: do not try to access
	a new repository with an old cvs binary or vice versa.)<br />Some
	time_t related bugs have been fixed; compat_openbsd(8) has been
	extended to the point that it successfully runs Mozilla&trade;
	Firefox&trade; and probably also Sun's native Java&trade;.</li>

<li>30.11.2004<br />
	The <a href="/?clog-2004#snap1129">new snapshot</a> is up via the
	<a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent tracker</a>.
	Today you will get excellent download rates, tomorrow we will have
	to reduce the upstream for cost reasons. It will appear on direct
	download mirrors later. Please test test test, we haven't been able
	to do so before. Time handling looks fixed now, OpenBSD emulation
	is pretty damn stable. [UPDATE] Everything which uses rusage()
	under emulatin (Linux or OpenBSD) is still broken.</li>

<li>24.11.2004<br />
	No new snapshot yet. Problems with time handling, both in our libc
	routines (by Ohlson, DJB and me) and in format string handlings
	(such as these in libcrypto of OpenSSL fame) have further delayed
	proliferation of a &quot;known good&quot; snapshot (ie. X.509 cert
	validation broke, so I couldn't use pine or lynx).<br />Let me
	repeat: It is <strong>important</strong> that, once the new snap
	is out, you all test it. I mean it.</li>

<li>21.11.2004<br />
	A <a href="/?clog-2004#snap1121">new snapshot</a> has been released
	via <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent</a> and <a
	href="/?getting">direct download</a>. New features: fixed Linux and
	newly written OpenBSD 3.6-current emulation; lots of bug fixes. This
	snapshot is a &quot;known good&quot; state of MirOS #8-beta; we will
	start porting cvs-1.12 and gcc-3.4 now that this snapshot is released.
	See you at <a href="http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/">21C3</a>!<br />
	Update: the snapshot is <strong>revoked</strong> for both bugs in the
	installer/ramdisk and <strong>corrupt</strong> time handling!</li>

<li>12.11.2004<br />
	After a week full of work, the website has been restructured. New
	versions of <a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirbsdKsh">mksh</a> (a
	temporary beta version), <a
	href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirMake">make</a> (still experimental,
	but much better) and <a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/JuppEditor">joe
	(jupp)</a> (new) have been released; refer to the individual pages
	for a complete list of changes to these. The hbSuite performs very
	stable.</li>

<li>07.11.2004<br />
	MirDNS #2 and hbServer/hbClient for the heartbeat protocol have been
	written, alongside with a few fixes and extensions to the base system.
	There is a small speedup in the kernel (-current) and MirPorts.</li>

<li>03.11.2004<br />
	Experimental support for PHP 5 has been added to MirPorts, and a huge
	number of other ports fixed, updated or added. The kernel has received
	fixes and speed-ups, and the userland is in a better shape now as
	well. Snapshots will be announced later. [update] php5 looks good.</li>

<li>31.10.2004<br />
	The COMPAT_OPENBSD system is now ready for general gamma test
	(means, I've fixed it during alpha-test and haven't found another
	bug during beta-test, now it's your turn to help test the snapshots).
	Mirbsdksh has gained the ability to spawn on a different terminal;
	since this is for root only, it will probably be used mainly on
	rescue systems. Severe usability bugs in ssh have been fixed.<br />
	OpenBSD 3.6 is out, congrats to our upstream project! For certain
	reasons, we'd like to warn you from using inofficial ISOs or
	downloads, and urge you to buy the CDs instead. (The OpenBSD project
	does not cryptographically sign their FTP/HTTP/AFS releases or
	distribute (signed) torrents.)</li>

<li>16.10.2004<br />
	The first public snapshot of MirOS #8-beta is up. We are now at
	the stage of feature-completeness, so the only issues missing
	are to port gcc 3.4 (first coregcc), reactivate support for the
	sparc platform, make non-core gcc 3.4 running (Objective-C, C++,
	Java&trade;, Ada, Pascal, Fortran - not considered part of MirOS)
	and start release engineering.</li>

<li>11.10.2004<br />
	Waldemar Brodkorb left the project. We wish him luck for the work
	on his diploma, and hope for a nice comeback to the BSD community.
	HEAD has been deemed ripe enough for MirOS #8-beta, 1 year and two
	weeks after #7semel has been released, and exactly two years after
	MirOS #0 had been uploaded, long ago. We'll take this opportunity
	and remind you to fight against patents on algorithms, business
	models, interfaces and data structures; also we'd like to remind
	you that licencing policy should be easy, and trademark policy
	disasters such as the Mozilla&trade; one avoided.</li>

<li>09.10.2004<br />
	You are now able with MirOS HEAD to cross-compile to different
	platforms and operating systems, if you can provide include files
	and libraries. This has been verified against i386-pc-linux-gnu
	from i386-ecce-mirbsd7 using Debian GNU/Linux includes and libs.</li>

<li>25.09.2004<br />
	Good news: we've got a Strato dedicated server which will be set up
	these days in order to provide a central AnonRSYNC server to our
	mirrors and developers, and /cvs moves from the elderly Pentium-120
	(herc) to a shiny new Soekris net4801 Geode-266 box (loki).<br />
	The <tt>MirOS X.509 Certification Authority</tt> is gone; uuencode,
	md5 and ssh-keygen have undergone changes in order to supplement the
	upcoming <tt>MirPG</tt> (pgp-2.6.3 replacement written in mirbsdksh,
	depending only on tools from the base system).<br /> Many ports have
	been enhanced, updated or fixed; the system is considered <tt>stable,
	sane for general use</tt> now, although there are a few known bugs
	and security issues left.<br />We're increasing the total number of
	(in- and active) developers to seven; welcome tyler@ to MirOS!</li>

<li>17.09.2004<br />
	Looks like most of the issues with SSP have been sorted out.
	GNU binutils have been updated, too; expect a snapshot RSN.</li>

<li>16.09.2004<br />
	Currently, there are undergoing efforts to use -fstack-protector-all
	on the system by default, yielding an even better SSP/ProPolice
	protection (and maybe the discovery of bugs, or already shortcomings
	of the system). After that, we will try to upgrade CVS to a more
	recent -stable version, sync to OpenBSD 3.6-current, import the GNU
	Compiler Collection 3.4 (or 3.5, but I don't think so) and prepare
	the long-awaited release, Codename <i>MirOS XP</i>.<br />
	MirPorts also gets some updates - a bit fresh code, bug-fixes and
	<strong>Firesomething</strong> (a certain web browser) finally
	works (tested on OpenBSD/i386).</li>

<li>29.08.2004<br />
	Happy Birthday! MirOS is now being worked on for two years. The
	linuxulator is fixed in time and SSH updated for the <a
	href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">birthday snapshot</a>.
	Surprise, surprise! We've got a new <a
	href="http://mirbsd.etherkiller.de/">website mirror</a> (without
	the more fancy stuff such as Wiki, CVSweb etc.) - if you encounter
	broken links, please report to the development team. Thanks.<br />
	Update: the MirPorts snapshot delivered with the birthday snapshot
	torrent does not work as-is; please upgrade. You might also want to
	update libc, because the hash functions are broken.</li>

<li>22.08.2004<br />
	Progress has been made: binutils support all 32-bit and 64-bit
	targets possible (and coded) now, and httpd is back on track and
	working (just not with all diffs we would liked to have). OpenSSH
	has been updated from the upstream 3.9 (not portable) version.<br />
	Next week will be dedicated to fixing stuff, so that we can release
	a birthday snapshot - we've been working for two years!</li>

<li>16.08.2004<br />
	There are new snapshots available at the usual place via <a
	href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent</a>; please do
	not forget to check the PGP signatures on the files. Also, we
	have prepared a new seed for people wishing to rsync our CVS,
	see the <a href="/?anoncvs">appropriate page</a> (bottom). The <a
	href="/cman/">online manual pages</a> have been updated to reflect
	the current state of the art.<br />We're awaiting your <a
	href="mailto:miros-discuss@66h.42h.de">reports</a> on how you
	tested the new snapshot and like MirOS - and if you want to fix
	stuff, please don't be shy, send an unidiff!</li>

<li>14.08.2004<br />
	GENERIC (bsd) and RAMDISK (bsd.rd) are now the same file, binutils
	have been merged (not gdb or gprof), and HEAD builds again. Snapshots
	will follow in a while for the public to test.</li>

<li>10.08.2004<br />
	We now have online manual pages for all basic sections: <a
	href="/man1/">1</a> <a href="/man2/">2</a> <a href="/man3/">3</a> <a
	href="/man4/">4</a> <a href="/man5/">5</a> <a href="/man6/">9</a> <a
	href="/man7/">7</a> <a href="/man8/">8</a> <a href="/man9/">9</a>.
	The Perl manual pages are not online due to their uselessness, and
	search and apropos functions will probably be implemented later.<br />
	Some time ago, a user has written an <a href="/?isdn">ISDN 4 MirOS
	Howto</a>, which was not yet linked.</li>

<li>09.08.2004<br />
	HEAD still does not build, but the situation gets better: libobjc
	and libstdc++ have left the tree; libreadline has been updated to
	GNU readline 5.0 and libiberty to GNU gdb 6.2; gcc has been adjusted
	for these changes.<br />MirLibtool is now on 1.5.8 level, and there
	have been some changes in MirPorts related to that, meaning it's
	an unstable time again.</li>

<li>05.08.2004<br />
	Since this page is intended for &quot;official press releases&quot;,
	sort of at least, there's a new news page up in the Wiki, the <a
	href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirNews">collaborative MirNews</a>
	page.<br />Besides that, we're currently discussing the future of
	MirPorts w.r.t. OpenBSD Ports, and fixing some minor bugs. The
	libpng contained within the -current base system has been updated
	to fix the current security problems.</li>

<li>22.07.2004<br />
	We've got three new developers: Waldemar Brodkorb, who has helped
	out with MirPorts once, comes back after he finishes his
	"Praxissemester" at the university, being the number one responsible
	for keeping MirPorts on OpenBSD working. Stephen Paskaluk and Dave
	Steinberg from the ekkoBSD project are going to commit minor patches
	themselfes if they stumble across a thing, help with the website and
	discussion of the project's future, and Dave will continue his work
	on fdialog, a free clone of the GPL licenced dialog programme known
	to most people as the front-end of a Linux 'make menuconfig'.<br />
	We're currently working in the interna of MirOS; don't expect a new
	snapshot before mid-August. If you experience xterm crashes with
	the <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">current snapshot</a>,
	cvs up in <tt>src/X-Window/xc/programs/xterm</tt> and rebuild (I
	used imake(1) and a hack, but learned today that xmkmf(1) exists).</li>

<li>20.07.2004<br />
	The <a href="http://www.ekkoBSD.org/">ekkoBSD</a> project is no
	more, and we also had to drop some things due to lack of time
	for maintenance. The sparc port goes over board, it was just
	too slow (sorry to the XFree86 guys that I could not live up
	for my promise to build XF86 4.4.0 on sparc), and I've got to
	do enough with i386, overall, ports infrastructure, etc.<br />
	Some other things also left (gcc2, gcc3's Fortran 77, FreeBSD
	and BSD/OS personalities) or will leave the tree (gcc3's non-C
	languages), some (gcc2, gcc3) will appear as port though.
	Some major changes are undergoing, so do not build -current
	right now - it's unusable (httpd, binutils need merging).
	We promise to not "die" within the next two years or so.</li>

<li>02.07.2004<br />
	The leap second code in the kernel now is being used, and finally,
	the clock is always correct - TAI seconds in the kernel, UTC date
	and time-of-day in the RTC. MirPorts now installs all subpackages
	of a port just built by default, recursively calling pkg_add.
	New snapshots will come up later these days.</li>

<li>29.06.2004<br />
	LinuxTag is over, and there are two CD ISOs available for download
	via <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BitTorrent</a>. The
	MirOS #7quater CD works with the MirPorts snapshot it comes with,
	but for current ports it needs <a href="/?ports">updating</a>. If
	you want to upgrade to -current, please notice that you cannot
	execute old OpenBSD or MirOS BSD binaries, and probably no Linux,
	FreeBSD or BSD/OS binaries either <b>yet</b>. Also, the file
	<tt>/etc/rc</tt> on the -current snapshot ISO is broken; you must
	replace the "}" on line 304 with "esac".<br />bsiegert@ has updated
	the errata pages and announced the snapshot on freshmeat, and we
	sold about 80 CDs and 25 T-Shirts - there are still T-Shirts
	available for snail mailing; contact tg@ if interested.</li>

<li>17.06.2004<br />
	For all brave people, I've prepared a new development snapshot.
	Be advised though that this neither contains the latest security
	fixes (for example for (m(ir))httpd), nor the OpenBSD emulation
	(ie, you can't execute MirOS-stable or oldcurrent binaries under
	this snapshot), nor will the next snapshot be binary compatible
	(according to some FreeBSD guy, it will have a hard time executing
	these). And the boot loader is everything but tested.</li>

<li>15.06.2004<br />
	MirOS #7quater has been released - the CD ISO is currently being
	distributed among the team in order to be given away at <a
	href="http://www.linuxtag.de/">LinuxTag 2004, Booth B62</a> and
	will be published via <a href="http://f.scarywater.net/miros/">BT</a>
	a couple of days after. The binary distribution sets can be
	downloaded now, as well as an update from MirOS #7ter.<br />
	MirPorts have been restructured, please read <a href="/?ports">the
	instructions</a> <strong>before</strong> upgrading!</li>

<li>05.06.2004<br />
	Not a big update, though: MirOS #7 has been released for the first
	time, but since it's merely a binary (not even built and uploaded
	yet) snapshot of MirOS #7-stable, that's not big news. As for the
	HEAD branch - please refrain from using it for a little while.</li>

<li>15.05.2004<br />
	The <a href="http://wiki.mirbsd.de/HomePage">MirWiki</a> has gone
	live; please enjoy! It's modeled after the <a
	href="http://wiki.koeln.ccc.de/">CVier</a> using UseMod.<br />
	anonCVS and anonRSYNC at mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org are working.</li>

<li>13.05.2004<br />
	Deprotect Advisories &lt;advisories@deprotect.com&gt; has found, via
	OpenBSD, a local memory read hole in the default MirOS installation.
	Workaround: umount /proc and refrain from using it.</li>

<li>02.05.2004, updated 04.05.2004, updated 08.05.2004<br />
	There is a <a href="/MirOS/current/i386/">new Snapshot</a> of MirOS,
	dated 01.05.2004, available for download via HTTP and HTTPS. If you
	do not install the egcs7.ngz set, you need to manually unpack the
	noegcs7.tgz file after installation. If you would like to use the
	X-Window system (XFree86 4.4.0, with a 180% speed bust for S3 Savage
	users), you must manually update the server by unpacking xf86-fixed.tgz
	(detached PGP signature available) after installation.<br />
	Soon, a BitTorrent Download will be
	A BitTorrent Download is
	available for a snapshot dated 03.05.2004, which fixes the issues
	above and updates some other components. This is the first time we
	distribute a snapshot via BitTorrent, so please <a
	href="mailto:miros-discuss@66h.42h.de">join us to discuss</a> and
	submit feedback about this method. (We don't have a way to seed
	the download with more than 4 KiB/sec yet, if you are interested
	in helping to seed, please contact us.) - It appears that using
	BitTorrent is a success, but not many people are downloading; that's
	why we have opened a <a href="/?errata">page about issues with prior
	releases and snapshots</a> so you _know_ why to update.<br />
	<em>Addendum:</em> there's a binary fixup package available at
	the BitTorrent page, too. Please install.<br />
	The website will get casual updates over the next few days.</li>

<li>28.04.2004<br />
	I admit we've been slacking w.r.t. the website lately; information
	will be fed into it later. We're busy preparing new snapshots of
	-current (i386) and the MirOS BSD #7quater (sparc) release, together
	with binary updates for #7ter.<br />MirOS #7quater is a snapshot of
	the MIRBSD_7 branch (MirOS #7-stable), including an updated ksh, new
	pkgtools and ability to run current ports.</li>

<li>13.04.2004<br />
	Georgina O Economou from the XFree86 project reminds us to announce
	that XFree86 4.4.0 is included in MirOS-current (snapshots will be
	available soon), and to improve this site's readability by providing
	<a href="/?style">different style sheets</a> for selection.</li>

<li>19.03.2004<br />
	Benny Siegert has MFCd the latest OpenBSD errata into MirOS-stable
	and issued temporary binary upgrade ustar-balls for i386. For a full
	binary install or upgrade (site34.tgz) for i386 and sparc, please
	stay tuned, we're still lacking equipment and time.</li>

<li>13.03.2004<br />
	There is a new snapshot <a href="/MirOS/current/i386/">available</a>,
	i386 only; Slashdot didn't want the story. <strong>AnonCVS is
	<b>not</b> working at the moment</strong>, the mirror's root will
	fix it soon. <a href="/?ports">Ports</a> are being fixed.<br />
	Press coverage of the new snapshot, including discussion, is at <a

<li>05.03.2004<br />
	An admin at BSDadvocacy has helped us restore the downloads for
	the #7ter release of MirOS BSD. Thanks.</li>

<li>02.03.2004<br />
	The following languages are now supported: C C++ Objective-C Ada
	Fortran-77. Pascal breaks (some BSD make guru out there who volunteers
	to help us finding the circular dependency I don't see?), and the
	Java&trade;-compatible subsystem is not in tree. Overall breakage
	for -current version is reduced, but for #7 users, the best bet is
	still to stick with #7bis ports. &mdash; MirPorts are now guarded
	by SYSTRACE unless overridden by a port or the user, for increased
	security and less damage done to the install.</li>

<li>29.02.2004<br />
	MirOS gcc3 now supports Ada in addition to C and C++ front-ends.
	Support for Pascal, Objective C, Fortran and maybe Java&trade;
	will come as time permits. Upgrading by source is not possible.</li>

<li>25.02.2004<br />
	We have survived FOSDEM and may bring you good news:
	MirOS has been a success, we've even distributed more flyers
	than the FreeBSD project (with whom we were very friendly btw).
	Since today, MirPorts uses the SVR4 CPIO format with CRC as its
	default packaging format.<br />Please beware that MirPorts are
	currently at a stage in development where everything and his
	little brother is broken due to a broken design choice in GNU
	Libtool, Automake, Autoconf and M4 implementations and follow-up
	breakage in almost any programme. We are working on it.
	There are no issues left except for time.</li>

<li>Announcement<br />
	From 01.02.2004 onwards, announcements and other information
	to the public, will be PGP signed by one of the MirOS
	developers' keys, listed <a

	Snapshots of i386-current are almost ready. Improvements:
	new CSU from GCC3; WineX is working. Improved linking of
	code (libgcc.so.1.0), especially C++ shared libraries
	(libGLU, for example). Big bug and warning fix round all
	through the base. Real fixes for X-Window.</li>

<li>20.01.2004<br />
	MirOS #7-stable was brought on track with security fixes.
	MirOS-current has been brought up to date, both MirPorts
	and GCC 3.x-wise, with OpenBSD-current (where feasible).
	The MirOS developers now have cross-signed PGP keys.</li>

<li>14.01.2004<br />
	A sad thing happened: all history of MirOS prior to -current,
	except for the CVS repository, is lost forever.
	They were saved on a hard disc on mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org, and
	could not have been backed up at our homes because of storage
	problems (no big HDDs here in .de). All binaries have been
	deleted here. We will re-upload the #7ter version, with amends
	from #7-stable, later. We will ensure integrity of the CVS
	repository mirror as soon as possible. (The hardware problems
	which caused bad checksums have been resolved on the server
	side, thanks to Josh for his good tracking down the bug.)<br />
	Waldemar Brodkorb leaves the team for personal reasons.</li>

<li>03.01.2004<br />
	Asides from updating base system code with latest OpenBSD-current,
	the new package tools code is finally written and being tested,
	which means MirPorts can be updated soon as well. Changes in the
	MirPorts Framework code residing in the <tt>src/</tt> repository
	will be mirrored in the stable branch. Work on a depenguinator
	(MirOS remote installer) has been started as well. You can now
	place the MirBSD partition into an extended partition.</li>

<li>30.12.2003<br />
	There is now a MirOS #7-stable branch, maintained by
	Benny Siegert. 20C3 is over, and it was great.</li>

<li>27.12.2003<br />
	Apparently, anonCVS at mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org is back
	up and running - a great thanks to selerius.</li>

<li>25.12.2003<br />
	Due to the emergency of 20C3 and apparent problems with
	flakey RAM at BSDadvocacy, a temporary mirror has been
	established for the website only (no download, no CVS).</li>

<li>23.12.2003<br />
	We were going to hold a speech at <a
	href="http://www.ccc.de/">20C3</a>, the Chaos Communication
	Congress we are going to attend, in order to introduce people
	to the existence and features of MirOS. Since the people
	responsible for making up the timetable seem to be smoking
	shit and no mail or other way of communication has been
	answered, tg@ personally isn't interested in a speech any more.</li>

<li>21.12.2003<br />
	The current version features Perl 5.8.2, working gcc-3 with
	passed propolice regression test and functional libstdc++,
	as well as a /boot which can be started from within MS-DOS
	or be burnt onto a CD-R in &quot;no emulation&quot; mode.
	Sendmail is built with libmilter by default.</li>

<li>05.12.2003<br />
	The switch to gcc 3.2.3 was finally done in the HEAD branch,
	still i386 only on purpose. Stay tuned. (The remaining issues
	with libstdc++ and libtool have been sorted out on 10.12.2003,
	completing the switch. A snapshot has been uploaded, minus the
	corrected gcc version string, on 12.12.2003.)</li>

<li>01.12.2003<br />
	The CVS slave repository at <tt>mirbsd-cvs@mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:/cvs</tt>
	is now synched daily. Expect it to be consistently updated
	at about 08:30 UTC. (Update: apparently the anoncvs service
	is not working. We're trying to contact root.)</li>

<li>30.11.2003<br />
	The GNU compiler collection 3.2.3 can now be used to build
	MirOS, but will not yet be used as default compiler because
	propolice cannot be currently enabled (it leads to internal
	compiler errors). This adds back libGLU support to XFree86, too.</li>

<li>22.11.2003<br />
	MirOS BSD #7ter has been released. Its binary builds will be
	finished and uploaded to the main distribution server soon.
	Anyone who wants to mirror, please contact us.</li>

<li>16.11.2003<br />
	<tt>tg@</tt> reports success in building through the i386 port of
	the #7 development branch, and prepares for the release.</li>

<li>14.11.2003<br />
	<tt>wbx@</tt> reports success in building through the sparc port of
	the #7 development branch.</li>

<li>23.10.2003<br />
	Open a &quot;development branch&quot; with the CVS Tag MIRBSD_7_DEV,
	which will be used to perform updates and bug fixes on the codebase
	of MirBSD #7 (semel, bis, ...) and eventually release new versions
	of MirOS BSD #7 (ter, ...) which are still pgcc-based. They'll be
	inheriting the OpenBSD 3.4 Errata where applicable, and releases
	will only be made if there are no regressions against older releases
	from the MIRBSD_7{,_DEV} branch. The branch will be regularily pulled
	into the HEAD branch where applicable.</li>
