Title: Why don't I have colours on the console?

<p>The first virtual terminal is the system console, unless the
 system runs from serial console. Use Ctrl-Alt-F2 to switch to
 the second one, whose terminal type defaults to “wsvt25”, thus
 allowing colors and more advanced features.</p>
<p>This does not work on sparc, as there is only one virtual
 console on wsfb-using devices. You can, however, simply “export
 TERM=wsvtg” there, as the sparc system console, wsdisplay(4),
 emulates a colourful VT100/VT220 as well, in MirOS #10.</p>

Title: Where do I place my SSH public keys?
Section: Common ssh(1) and sshd(8) problems	XXX do this differently!

<p>sshd(8): The name is <tt>~/.etc/ssh/authorised_keys</tt> (british
 spelling), but <tt>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt> (upstream standard
 location) ought to work as well, for compatibility reasons.</p>

Title: SSH host key verification fails for your servers, e.g. on “cvs up”
Section: Common ssh(1) and sshd(8) problems	XXX do this differently!

<p>ssh(1): The <tt>anoncvs.mirbsd.org,85.214.23.162</tt> host entry
 in the MirOS #10 (RELEASE) default ssh <tt>known_hosts</tt> file is
 our old server, which ran on a Debian virtual host and, as such, was
 victim to the “private keys with only 15 bits of entropy” problem.
 A <a href="@@RELPATH@@overview.htm#ssh_host">list of SSH host keys</a>
 used by our publicly accessible servers contains the currently valid
 entries; <a href="@@RELPATH@@permalinks/news_e20080515-tg.htm">we
 reported the problem</a> earlier in the news.</p>
