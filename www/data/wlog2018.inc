Title: Website consolidation

<p>I’m currently working on consolidating <tt>mirsolutions.de</tt>
 (as my former business is long defunct) and “The MirOS Project”
 (that as of 2018 is also back to being my own one-man show / hobby)
 into <tt>www.mirbsd.org</tt> as my hobby / personal sorta homepage
 to not need any vhosts and simplify EU-DSGVO conformity. (I’ve also
 reduced logging.) Please excuse upheavals, as well as the continued
 presence of old, obsoleted or outdated content that may even be, as
 of now, completely wrong; I’ll fix it as time permits.</p>

Title: mksh bugfix — thank you for the music
Tag: bug debian mksh pcli

<p>I’m currently working on an mksh(1) and bc(1) script that takes
 a pitch standard (e.g. “A₄ = 440 Hz” or “C₄ = 256 Hz”) and a config
 file describing a temperament (e.g. the usual equal temperament,
 or Pythagorean untempered pure fifths (with the wolf), or “just”
 intonation, Werckmeister Ⅲ, Vallotti or Bach/Lehman 1722 (to name
 a few; these are all temperaments that handle enharmonics the same
 or, for Pythagorean in out case, ignore the fact they’re unplayable).
 Temperaments are rule-based, like in ttuner. Well, I’m not quite
 there yet, but I’m already able to display the value for MuseScore
 to adjust its pitch standard (it can only take A₄-based values), a
 frequency table, and a list and table of cent deltas (useful for using
 or comparing with other tuners). Of course, right now, the cent deltas
 are all 0 because, well, they are equal temperament against equal
 temperament (as baseline), but I can calculate <em>that</em> with
 arbitrary and very high precision!</p>
<p>For outputting, I wanted to make the tables align nicely; column(1),
 which I normally use, was out because it always left-aligns, so I used
 string padding in Korn Shell — except I’m also a Unicode BMP fan, so I
 had F♯ and B♭ in my table headings, which were for some reason correctly
 right-aligned (for when the table values were integers) but not padded
 right when aligning with the decimal dot. So I worked around it, but
 also investigated.</p>
<p>Turns out that the desired length was used as second snprintf(3)
 argument, instead of, as in the right-align case, the buffer size.
 This worked only until multibyte characters happened. A fun bug,
 which only took about three minutes to find, and is covered by a
 new check in the testsuite even. Thought I’d share.</p>
<p>Feedback on and improvements for the tuner, once it’ll be done,
 are, of course, also welcome. I plan to port the algorithm (once
 I’ve got it down in a programming language I know <em>well</em>)
 to QML for inclusion in the tuner MuseScore plugin, even. Check <a
 href="@@ABSPATH@@/music/resources/tuner.sh">here, for now</a>, for
 my work in progress… it’s quite big already despite doing basically
 nothing. Foundation laid (or so…).</p>

Title: Progress report from the Movim packaging sprint at MiniDebconf
Tag: debian

<p>Nik wishes you to know that the Movim packaging sprint (sponsored
 by the DPL, thank you!) is handled under the umbrella of the Debian
 Edu sprint (similarily sponsored) since this package is handled by
 the Teckids Debian Task Force, personnel from Teckids e.V.</p>
<p>After arriving, I’ve started collecting knowledge first. I reviewed
 upstream’s <tt>composer.json</tt> file and Wiki page about dependencies
 and, after it quickly became apparent that we need <em>much</em> more
 information (e.g. which versions are in sid, what the package names are,
 and, most importantly, <strong>recursive</strong> dependencies), a <a
 href="https://wiki.teckids.org/wiki/MovimPaketierungsNotizen">Wiki page
 of our own</a> grew. Then I made a hunt for information about how to
 package stuff that uses PHP Composer upstream, and found the, ahem,
 wonderfully abundant, structured, plentiful and clear documentation from
 the Debian PHP/PEAR Packaging team. (Some time and reverse-engineering
 later I figured out that we just ignore <tt>composer</tt> and read its
 control file in <tt>pkg-php-tools</tt> converting dependency information
 to Debian package relationships. Much time later I also figured out it
 mangles package names in a specific way and had to rename one of the
 packages I created in the meantime… thankfully before having uploaded
 it.) Quickly, the Wiki page grew listing the package names we’re supposed
 to use. I created a package which I could use as template for all others
 later.</p>
<p>The upstream Movim developer arrived as well — we have quite an amount
 of upstream developers of various projects attending MiniDebConf, to the
 joy of the attendees actually directly involved in Debian, and this makes
 things much easier, as he immediately started removing dependencies (to
 make our job easier) and fixing bugs and helping us understand how some
 of those dependencies work. (I also contributed code upstream that replaces
 some Unicode codepoints or sequences thereof, such as 3⃣ or ‼ or 👱🏻‍♀️,
 with &lt;img…/&gt; tags pointing to the SVG images shipped with Movim, with
 a description (generated from their Unicode names) in the alt attribute.)</p>
<p>Now, Saturday, all dependencies are packaged so far, although we’re still
 waiting for maintainer feedback for those two we’d need to NMU (or have them
 upload or us take the packages over); most are in NEW of course, but that’s
 no problem. Now we can tackle packaging Movim itself — I guess we’ll see
 whether those other packages actually work then ☺</p>
<p>We also had a chance to fix bugs in other packages, like guacamole-client
 and musescore.</p>
<p>In the meantime we’ve also had the chance to socialise, discuss, meet, etc.
 other Debian Developers and associates and enjoy the wonderful food and superb
 coffee of the “Cantina” at the venue; let me hereby express heartfelt thanks
 to the MiniDebConf organisation for this good location pick!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>, later this night: we took over the remaining two
 packages with permission from their previous team and uploader, and have
 already started with actually packaging Movim, discovering untold gruesome
 things in the <em>upstream</em> of the two webfonts it bundles.</p>

Title: learn.to/quote
Tag: archaeology debian news pcli tip

<p>The “properly quote eMail messages and on Usenet” documentation
 is hosted on a server that appears to not get too much care at the
 moment. I’ve dug out workable versions:</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.afaik.de/usenet/faq/zitieren/download/zitieren-alles.html">current
 all-in-one-page German version (<span xml:lang="de-DE-1901">aktuelle
 alles-auf-einer-Seite-Fassung auf Deutsch</span>)</a>, with a short
 link on <tt>http://deb.li/quote</tt></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170227223930/http://www.briachons.org:80/art/quote/">last
 archived Dutch version (<span xml:lang="nl">laatste versie in het
 Nederlands</span>)</a>, the server is currently unreachable, but
 the Wayback Machine still has it</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html">current
 English translation</a>, still workable</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.afaik.de/usenet/faq/zitieren/">original
 link</a>, with its <tt>http://learn.to/quote/</tt> redirection,
 which contained the links to the translations into Dutch and
 English, unfortunately no longer works.</p>
<p>I’m asking everyone to <em>please</em> honour these guidelines
 when posting in Usenet and responding to eMail messages, as not
 doing so is an insult to <em>all</em> the (<em>multiple</em>, in
 the case of Usenet and mailing lists) readers / recipients of your
 messages. Even if you have to spend a little time trimming the
 quote, it’s much less than the time spent by <em>all</em> readers
 trying to figure out a TOFU (reply over fullquote) message.</p>
<p xml:lang="de-DE-1901">Ich bitte jeden darum, sich <em>bitte</em>
 beim Posten im Usenet und Verfassen von eMails sich an diese
 Richtilinien zu halten; dies nicht zu tun ist ein Affront wider
 <em>alle</em> (im Falle von Usenet und Mailinglisten viele)
 Leser bzw. Empfänger eurer Nachrichten. Selbst wenn man zum
 Kürzen des Zitats ein bißchen Zeit aufwenden muß ist das immer
 noch deutlich weniger als die Mühe, die <em>jeder einzelne</em>
 Leser aufwenden muß, herauszufinden, was mit einer als TOFU
 (Text oben, Vollzitat unten) geschriebenen eMail gemeint ist.</p>
<p xml:lang="nl">Mag ik iederéén verzoeken, postings in het Usenet
 en mailtjes volgens deze regels te schrĳven? Als het niet te doen
 is vies tegen <em>alle</em> ontvanger’s en moeilĳk om te lezen.
 Zelfs als je een beetje tĳd nodig heb om het oorspronkelĳke deel
 te korten is het nog steeds minder dan de moeite van alleman, om
 een TOFU (antwoord boven, fullquote beneden) boodschap proberen
 te begrepen.</p>
