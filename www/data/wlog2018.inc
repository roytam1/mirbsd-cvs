Title: FOSDEM
Tag: event fun

<p>I’ve been going to FOSDEM for about half of my lifetime,
 give or take a year I think. So, of course, I will be there
 again this year. Thanks to my employer for sponsoring travel
 and accommodation again.</p>
<p>It’s a bit annoying that the future of alternative OSes is
 a bit misty right now, depending on the hardware, but we’re
 continuing development, in subprojects (like mksh(1) and
 jupp(1), for example) and other projects (like Debian and
 MuseScore, whom I’ll meet at FOSDEM again) while researching
 possible fixes for the security theatre.</p>

Title: Groeten vanuit Brussels, tĳdens FOSDEM
Tag: event personal

<p>I’m in Bruxelles again, as every year since 2001, for <a
 href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>. (I only missed OSDEM
 in 2000, mostly due to the curse of late birth.)</p>
<p>To revive a tradition, I’ve attempted (and successfully
 at that!) to find a place where we can eat Couscous Merguez,
 and we met up with bsiegert@ and had some nice conversation
 and, besides the overly LOUD!!! belly dance, delicious food.
 It was nice to catch up with each other again.</p>
<p>Other than that, see you over the next few days at ULB!
 Don’t miss the MuseScore booth and the two Teckids talks.</p>

Title: Happy Birthday, GPS Stash Hunt!
Tag: debian fun geocache personal

<p>GPS Stash Hunt, also commercially known as “Geocaching”,
 “Terracaching”, or non-commercially (but also nōn-free) as
 “Opencaching”, is 18 years old today! Time for celebration
 or something!</p><!-- RSS stop -->

 src="@@RELPATH@@WPtg.png" /></a></p>
<p>Excluding Munzees, I visited 2365 waypoints to date,
 ever since 2006 (I knew about GPS Stash Hunt in 2004
 already but thought one’d need one of those expensive
 GPS receivers to play, which is untrue but I only got
 that when Pfeffer (from BOSng) took his GPS and me out
 for a bike tour in 2006, so, here we are…</p>
<p>(Some older on-platform logs have a number that still
 counts Munzees; the current format uses “number﹟”.)</p>

Title: Website consolidation

<p>I’m currently working on consolidating <tt>mirsolutions.de</tt>
 (as my former business is long defunct) and “The MirOS Project”
 (that as of 2018 is also back to being my own one-man show / hobby)
 into <tt>www.mirbsd.org</tt> as my hobby / personal sorta homepage
 to not need any vhosts and simplify EU-DSGVO conformity. (I’ve also
 reduced logging.) Please excuse upheavals, as well as the continued
 presence of old, obsoleted or outdated content that may even be, as
 of now, completely wrong; I’ll fix it as time permits.</p>
