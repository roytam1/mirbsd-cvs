This is the source code for the generated part of the
MirBSD website. The source code is licenced material,
see below.

The “files/” and “pics/” subdirectories contain data that
is directly copied to the tarball. Licence terms for both
the files in these subdirectories and the output of files
generated by the source code are: a standard MirOS licen‐
ce applies, but you must not use the work or any derivate
thereof to endorse or promote products, opinions or other
work without specific prior written permission of the ow‐
ner of the respective work, and you must not use any ima‐
gery in a way despicable to the depicted. Some files come
under their own licences, you must honour these instead.

Any “textual content” embedded in the website source code
is obviously covered by the terms in files/LICENCE. (This
is due to it being transformed into output which is cove‐
red by these terms.)
