In addition, anyone is permitted to use the "favicon.ico" file under
the MirOS, ISC/OpenBSD, MIT, X11 or any BSD licence, as long as he's
got permission for the Dæmon mascot from Marshall Kirk McKusick.

The BSD dæmon is Copyright (c) 1988 by Marshall Kirk McKusick.
All Rights Reserved.  Individuals may use the daemon for their
personal use within the bounds of good taste.  When reasonably
possible, the text shown above is to be included.

The Shilouette dæmon is Copyright (c) 2003 by Rick Collette.
The MirOS Project may freely use the (former) ekkoBSD shilouette Daemon
Logo for MirBSD - on anything the project leader sees fit so long as it
pertains to MirBSD in some way and you give credit for the original dæ-
mon to Marshall Kirk McKusick.

The MirAbile logo (pics/logo-mirbsd.png) is property of Thorsten Glaser
and must not be used by anyone without an explicit written licence. It
is used on the website of the MirOS Project to represent "MirBSD" (the
predecessor of MirOS+MirPorts) and unmodified website mirrors are allowed
to display it for this purpose exactly as on the original website of the
MirOS Project and mirabile. Use the "MirOS Project" logo instead. Some
of the other images are also not freely available.
