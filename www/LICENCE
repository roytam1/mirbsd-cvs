This is the source code for the generated part of the new
website of the MirOS Project. The source code is licenced
material, see below.

The “files/” and “pics/” subdirectories contain data that
is directly copied to the tarball. Licence terms for both
the files in these subdirectories and the output of files
generated by the source code are in data/LICENCE.

Any “textual content” embedded in the website source code
is obviously covered by the terms in files/LICENCE. (This
is due to it being transformed into output which is cove-
red by these terms.)
