This is the source code for the generated part of the new
website of the MirOS Project. The source code is licenced
material, see below.

The “files/” and “pics/” subdirectories contain data that
is directly copied to the tarball. Licence terms for both
the files in these subdirectories and the output of files
generated by the source code are: a standard MirOS licen-
ce applies, but you must not use the work or any derivate
thereof to endorse or promote products, opinions or other
work without specific prior written permission of the ow-
ner of the respective work, and you must not use any ima-
gery in a way despicable to the depicted.

Any “textual content” embedded in the website source code
is obviously covered by the terms in files/LICENCE. (This
is due to it being transformed into output which is cove-
red by these terms.)
