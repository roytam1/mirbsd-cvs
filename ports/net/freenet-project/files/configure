| Freenet configuration - Fred settings                    |
------------------------------------------------------------

In order to make Fred run, several settings have to be
supplied. There are already some default values set,
however we need three pieces of information from you.

First, we need your public outside IP. Other nodes want to
contact you if you are a permanent (non-transient) node. The
default value here is your hostname, or "noname". If you do
not want to be a permanent node, set it to "noname".

IMPORTANT: Since recently, ALL freenet nodes SHOULD be permanent
if they are reachable from the outside and you do not have concerns
your IP appearing in other people's seednodes. Freenet nodes that
cannot be reached (e.g. behind a firewall) MUST be transient nodes!

cat <<EOF
Second, we need a port that can be reached from the
outside. The default value is random or 31337.

Third, we need your inside LAN IPv4 address in order to
publish freesites via fproxy to clients in your LAN. If
you do not want this feature, keep the default setting
and remove "pubfpx" from the services to start.

Let's go!
What is your hostname?
