# The IP address of this node as seen by the public internet.
# This is needed in order for the node to determine its own node
# reference. If you have a dynamic IP address, you may enter a
# host name in this field (assuming you have a dynamic DNS

# A comma-separated list of hosts that may connect to the FCP
# port (clientPort). If left blank, only the localhost will be

# the list or access won't be allowed from the local machine. May
# be given as IP addresses or host names.

# If this is set, then users that are authenticated owners of the

# adminPassword is also set both are required.

# Transient nodes do not give out references to themselves, and

# If this is true, the node will automatically announce to all
# nodes in the <seedFile> file, as specified by
# <announcementDelay>, etc.
#doAnnounce=true

# A file containing one or more node references which will be
# incorporated into the node's routing table on startup. A
# reference is only added if there is no previously existing

# announce to the nodes listed in this file.

diagnosticsPath=../stats

# Datastore implementation. Put "native" (without the quotes) if
# you want the new native filesystem datastore, which stores the
# files in a directory. Put "convert" to convert from an old
# monolithic store to a native store. Note that convert uses lots
# of disk space while doing the conversion (approximately twice
# the datastore size), and the resulting store may be
# (temporarily) slightly larger than the old one due to block
# size mismatch (this will be fixed as soon as the node tries to
# add a file to the store).
storeType=native

# The path to the file containing the node's private key, DSA
# group, cipher key, etc. Defaults to node_<port> in the current

# total maximum size of the files in the directory is given by
# <storeSize>. It will create new files in this dir, and DELETE

storeFile=../store

# The byte size of each data store file.  If there is more than
# one file, the total size of the store is the product of the
# number of files and <storeSize>. The maximum sized file that
# will be cached is 1/200th of this value, so we recommend the
# default 256MB, to cache the largest common file size on
# freenet, 1MB plus some headers
