This package contains userspace utilities and daemons necessary
to get the Alcatel Speedtouch USB ADSL Adapter working in Linux
without any (mandatory) kernel patches.

These drivers are GPLed and reverse engineered from scratch, and
provide an alternative to the official drivers which require
kernel patches and a binary-only management utility. However,
they do require a file containing the firmware for the adapter,
such as mgmt.o from the Linux management utility, or alcaudsl.sys
from the Windows drivers.
