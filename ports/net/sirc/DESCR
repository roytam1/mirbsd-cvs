sirc is an Internet Relay Chat programmable client written
in perl and C. It has a main perl script that can be run in
'dumb' mode, standalone, and a separate split-screen front
end in C, called ssfe.
ssfe actually comes quite handy, you can use it for example
as front-end for netcat/telnet (MUDs) or bnbot (chatting).

It sends characters encoded by default in UTF-8 to the server
and in ISO-8859-1 to the terminal, unless the locale(1) command
or start-up environment variables determine UTF-8 mode (for
non-dumb mode only). Control characters are stripped off.
The client has also support for sending ISO-8859-1 on the wire
and any character set supported by p5-Encode to the terminal.
Overlong lines are split automatically to smaller chunks.

This IRC client supports IPv6: http://www.feyrer.de/IPv6/
The RANDEX protocol originated in this client.

The new command ACCEPT from ratbox-ircd (Freeforge et al.) is
supported as well as the CAPAB IDENTIFY-MSG from dancer-ircd
and the newer variant CAP (Freenode/OPN et al.) which is
invoked automatically and shows messages from identified users
with different hook-like markers («»[[¬]]).

SSL is supported via /usr/sbin/openssl (which must be in your
current $PATH) by prefixing the port number with an 's' letter.
