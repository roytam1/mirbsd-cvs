sirc is an Internet Relay Chat programmable client written
in perl and C. It has a main perl script that can be run in
'dumb' mode, standalone, and a separate split-screen front
end in C, called ssfe.
ssfe actually comes quite handy, you can use it for example
as front-end for netcat/telnet (MUDs) or bnbot (chatting).

It sends characters encoded by default in utf-8 to the server
and in iso-8859-1 to the terminal. Control characters are
stripped off.
The client has also support for sending iso-8859-1 on the wire
and any character set supported by p5-Encode to the terminal.

This IRC client supports IPv6: http://www.feyrer.de/IPv6/
DCC support is totally broken, though.
