To get help on a particular topic, type "/help <topic>"  (without the

that <nickname> is connected to, or your own server by default.
@alias
Usage: ALIAS [[-]<aliasname> [substitution_text]]
Creates a substitution alias, or deletes one (preceding it with "-")
or shows one (giving the name only) or shows the whole list (without
arguments).
Aliases get substituted non-recursively (i.e once substituted it doesn't
check if it matches another alias). Substitution parameters are
implemented, so $0 evaluates to the first argument, $1 the second, etc.,
and $0- all of them, $1- from the 2nd on, etc. $variable_name expands
to the contents of that variable, such as $nick or $talkchannel (see
the PROGRAMMING docs for a list of these variables).
@away
Usage: AWAY [<text>]
Marks you as being away at the server-level, with the specified reason.
People will see the reason when they /msg you or /whois you. Without
arguments, marks you as being here again.
@bye
Usage: BYE [<text>]
Quits sirc, with an optional parting message.
@cd

is done. Then prints the current directory.

Can only be used by IRC Operators.

or the current one if none is specified.
Can be shortened to D.
@describe
Usage: DESCRIBE <nick>|<#channel> <action>

of the CTCP protocol.

@die
Usage: DIE
Causes your current server to exit.
Can only be used by IRC Operators, and doesn't seem to work anymore.
@eval
Usage: EVAL <perl code>

@exit
Usage: EXIT [<text>]
Quits sirc, with an optional parting message.
@help
Usage: HELP <topic>
Gets help on the specified topic, as you can see.
@highlight

Controls highlighting of arbitrary phrases.
Without arguments, shows you the current highlight list.

If you specify a perlre(1) pattern (which may contain spaces),
it will be added to the list, or removed if it begins with a "-".
@ignore
Usage: IGNORE [-][<pattern>]
Lets you ignore messages and notices from a list of users.
Without arguments, shows you the current ignorance list.

Patterns match only a nick, or a user@host, or a nick!user@host,
and can include the "*" wildcard.
Can be shortened to IG
Examples: /ig UgLyNiCk
          /ig loser@*stupid.site.edu
@info
Usage: INFO [<server>]
Shows server-generated information about IRC, creators, debuggers...
@invite
Usage: INVITE <nick1> [<nick2> ... ] [#channel]

you current channel is used.
Can be shortened to INV or to I.
@join
Usage: JOIN <channel_list> [<key>]
Joins channels. To join more than one at the same time, separate
them with "," but no spaces.

an initial # will be added automatically if the specified channelname
does not start with a # or &.
Channel names beginning with the character '&' are local to your server.
If the specified channel does not already exist, it will be created.
Joining a channel does not make you leave any other one.
Joining a channel when you're already in it makes it the 'current' one.

Note: unless you specify *one* channel, this command is very slow and
will often cause the server to drop your connection on large networks.
@ll
Usage: LL
Shows the list of users on your current channel in the /who format.
@load
Usage: LOAD <filename>
Loads a sirc script, which is actually a file of perl code, into

 n (no msgs to the #)    o <nick> (makes nick operator)
 p (private)   s (secret)   t (only ops can change the topic)
 v <nick>  (lets nick talk in a +m channel)  b <pattern> (ban)

Warns you whenever any of certain list of nicknames sign on or off.

is cleared.

@newuser
IRC is an international multi-user chat network organised in channels;
each IRC user is known by a nickname. Communication with other users
is either by private messages or by talking in channels.

All sirc commands begin with a /, and anything that does not begin
with a / is sent to your current channel.

To get started, it will be useful to check the help on the following
commands:  NICK, QUIT, LIST, WHOIS, MSG, JOIN, HOP, LL, keys
