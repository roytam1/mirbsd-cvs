To get help on a particular topic, type "/help <topic>"  (without the

that <nickname> is connected to, or your own server by default.
@alias
Usage: ALIAS [[-]<aliasname> [substitution_text]]
Creates a substitution alias, or deletes one (preceding it with "-")
or shows one (giving the name only) or shows the whole list (without
arguments).
Aliases get substituted non-recursively (i.e once substituted it doesn't
check if it matches another alias). Substitution parameters are
implemented, so $0 evaluates to the first argument, $1 the second, etc.,
and $0- all of them, $1- from the 2nd on, etc. $variable_name expands
to the contents of that variable, such as $nick or $talkchannel (see
the PROGRAMMING docs for a list of these variables).
@away
Usage: AWAY [<text>]
Marks you as being away at the server-level, with the specified reason.
People will see the reason when they /msg you or /whois you. Without
arguments, marks you as being here again.
@bye
Usage: BYE [<text>]
Quits sirc, with an optional parting message.
@cd
Usage: CD [<directory>]
Changes the current directory if one is specified; tilde-expansion
is done. Then prints the current directory.

  DCC RCHAT <nick1> <n2>  - renames a DCC CHAT
  DCC SEND <nick> <file>  - offers to send a file
  DCC GET <nick> [<file>] - starts getting a file
  DCC RENAME <nick> [<oldfilename>] <newfilename>
                              - renames a file before DCC GETting it
  DCC CLOSE <args>        - closes a DCC CHAT, GET or SEND;
                                <args> is CHAT, GET or SEND followed by

@eval
Usage: EVAL <perl code>

Examples: /ig UgLyNiCk
          /ig loser@*stupid.site.edu
@info

an initial # will be added automatically if the specified channelname
does not start with a # or &.
Channel names beginning with the character '&' are local to your server.
If the specified channel does not already exist, it will be created.
Joining a channel does not make you leave any other one.
Joining a channel when you're already in it makes it the 'current' one.
Can be shortened to J.
@kick
Usage: KICK [<#channel>] <nickname> [<reason>]

or for all those having at least <min> users, at most <max> users,
and matching the pattern <pattern>. Only "*" wildcards are allowed
in the pattern.
Note: unless you specify *one* channel, this command is very slow and
will often cause the server to drop your connection on large networks.
@ll
Usage: LL
Shows the list of users on your current channel in the /who format.
@load
Usage: LOAD <filename>
Loads a sirc script, which is actually a file of perl code, into
sirc's context. Tilde-expansion is done on the filename.
Please note that these scripts must be written for sirc - there's
NO way an ircII script will work with sirc.
@log

@logfile
Usage: LOGFILE [<filename>]
Shows the current logfile name, or sets one.

 n (no msgs to the #)    o <nick> (makes nick operator)
 p (private)   s (secret)   t (only ops can change the topic)
 v <nick>  (lets nick talk in a +m channel)  b <pattern> (ban)

with MSG is that you're guaranteed that you won't get any automatic
response.

@notify
Usage: NOTIFY [[-]<nickname> ...]
Warns you whenever any of certain list of nicknames sign on or off.

@set
Usage: SET [[-]<variable> [value]]

Do a /help set <variable> for help on specific variables.
The list of SET variables is:
CHARSET    CTCP       CTRL_T     EIGHT_BIT  FINGER
IRCNAME    LOADPATH   LOCALHOST  PRINTCHAN  PRINTUH
SENDAHEAD  SHOWTIME   USERINFO   UTF
Note that sirc scripts may add their own SET variables.
@set charset
Sets the local character set assumed.
The default is "iso-8859-1"; valid options are listed in Encode(3p).
@set ctcp
Sets the level of CTCP support in sirc.  The possible values are:
  none     --  not process CTCPs at all, treating them like text
  noreply  --  process CTCPs, never reply automatically to them
  noflood  --  process CTCPs, reply to up to 2 every 10 seconds
  all      --  process CTCPs, reply always (if appropriate)
The default is "none".  "on" is synonymous with "noflood", and
"off" with "noreply".
@set ctrl_t
Sets the string generated by the ^t key; the default is "/next".
@set eight_bit
Sets whether sirc will support eight-bit clean data (supposed to be
encoded as iso-8859-1).  The possible values are:
  off      --  map special chars to the closes US-ASCII equivalent
  on       --  pass all characters
The default is "on", unless sirc is started with -7.
@set finger
Sets the CTCP finger reply.
The default is "keep your fingers touching yourself", or whatever is
set in the $IRCFINGER environment variable.
@set ircname
Sets the IRCNAME for the next connection.  The default is a rude reply
or whatever is in the $SIRCNAME or $IRCNAME environment variables.
@set loadpath
Sets the path in which sirc looks for scripts to /load; it is
formatted as a list of pathnames separated by colons, and ~'s are
allowed.
@set localhost
Sets the IP address to connect from, for machines with more than one
IP address (virtual hosts).
@set printchan
Sets whether sirc will print the channel name next to channel output
for the current default channel.  The possible values are:
  off      --  print it only when it's not the default channel
  on       --  print it always
The default is "off".
@set printuh
Sets whether sirc will print the user@host next to people's nicks in
various situations.  The possible values are:
  none     --  never print the user@host
  some     --  print them in private messages and a few other cases
  all      --  print them in all cases
The default is "none".  "off" is synonymous with "none" and "on" with
"all".
@set sendahead
Sets the amount (in bytes) by which DCC SEND will send ahead of the
acknowledged amount.  A value of 0 reverts to the old ircII-like
behavior; higher values speed up the transfer, although rising it more
than like 8k or so hardly makes a difference, and setting it higher
than what your Unix kernel is willing to buffer would be a bad idea.
The default value is 4096.
@set showtime
Sets whether sirc will show timestamps on messages.
@set userinfo
Sets the CTCP userinfo reply.
The default value is whatever is in the environment variable $USERINFO,
or "yep, I'm a happy OpenBSD user".
@set utf
Sets whether sirc will support UTF-8 conversion.
The possible values are:
  off      --  assume local == server == iso-8859-1, try to parse
                 input as utf-8 first though (windows-1252 as last resort)
  on       --  assume local == iso-8859-1 (try utf-8 first, windows-1252
                 last tho); send utf-8 to server and convert incoming utf-8,
                 iso-8859-1, iso-8859-15 as well as windows-1252 to local
                 iso-8859-1 (default); all this is totally weird... I know ;)
For local charsets, please refer to SET CHARSET as well.

Usage: SIGNOFF [<text>]
Quits sirc, with an optional parting message.
@silence
Usage: SILENCE [+|-]<nick>|<pattern>

@newuser
IRC is an international multi-user chat network organized in channels;
each IRC user is known by a nickname. Communication with other users
is either by private messages or by talking in channels.

All sirc commands begin with a /, and anything that does not begin
with a / is sent to your current channel.

To get started, it will be useful to check the help on the following
commands:  NICK, QUIT, LIST, WHOIS, MSG, JOIN, HOP, LL, keys
@keys
If you are using sirc with the full-screen interface (ssfe), these
editing keys are recognized (with ^key meaning Control-key):
  ^a              - go to the beginning of the line
  ^b, left arrow  - move left a letter
  ^d              - delete the character under the cursor
  ^e              - go to the end of the line
  ^f, right arrow - move right a letter
  ^h, del         - erase the previous character
  ^i, tab         - go to next /msg in msg history
  ^j, ^m, enter   - send the line
  ^k              - erase from the cursor to the end of the line
  ^l              - redisplay the status bar and the command line
  ^n, down arrow  - go to the next line in command-line history
  ^o              - type the last msg you got on the command line
  ^p, up arrow    - go to the previous line in command-line history
  ^t              - switch to the next channel you're on
  ^u              - erase command-line
  ^v              - insert the next character literally
  ^x b            - toggle beep on or off (off by default)
  ^x c            - exit the front end, back to the unix prompt
  ^x h            - toggle hold mode
  ^y              - yank line in the history without sending it
  ^z              - suspend sirc - you come back with 'fg'
