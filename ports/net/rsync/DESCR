Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool for
both remote and local files.  It communicates over a lower-level
protocol, such as rsh or ssh, allowing for secure updating.

Rsync uses a delta-transfer algorithm which provides a very fast method
for bringing remote files into sync.  It does this by sending just the
differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both
sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.
Typically, this uses a very small bandwidth compared to e.g. rdist.

On the down side, rsync is not quite as versatile as rdist when it comes to
mirroring only part of a hierarchy, though one can possibly use a perl
wrapper to obtain the same adaptability.

The rsync-static package is intended for use with AnonCVS as follows:
$ sudo install -c -o root -g _anoncvs -m 0110 \
    ${PREFIX}/bin/rsync-static /var/anoncvs/bin/rsync
