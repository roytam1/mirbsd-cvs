| Security Warning! XNetload needs access to the kernel memory in order to
| determine the number of bytes being transmitted and received on a given
| network interface. Therefore it is installed sgid kmem. If you are paranoid
| about this, do
| 
|	chmod 555 /usr/local/bin/xnetload
|  
| to remove the sgid bit from the executable.
