The Samba suite is a set of programmes which run under most UNIX
and UNIX-like operating systems and implement the Server Message
Block protocol suite. These programmes deliver most of the
important functionality of a Microsoft Lan Manager server. That
is, they support remote access to UNIX filespace and UNIX printers
from Lan Manager compatible clients. In practical terms, this
means that such clients can connect to and use UNIX filespace as
if it was a local disc drive, or UNIX printers as if they were
local printers.

Some of the most popular Lan Manager compatible clients include Lan
Manager itself, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2 and Windows NT.
