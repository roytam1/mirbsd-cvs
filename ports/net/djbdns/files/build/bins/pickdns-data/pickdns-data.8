.TH pickdns-data 8

.SH NAME
pickdns-data \- data tool for pickdns

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pickdns-data
reads local IP addresses
from a file named 
.I data
in the current directory.
It creates 
.I data.cdb
in a binary format designed for
fast access by 
.BR pickdns (8).
It may also create some other files
with names beginning with 
.IR data .

.B pickdns-data
updates 
.I data.cdb
atomically,
so you can use it safely while 
.BR pickdns (8)
is running.
If anything goes wrong with the creation of 
.IR data.cdb ,
.B pickdns-data
stops and leaves the old 
.I data.cdb
in place.

.SH Data format

+\fIfqdn\fR:\fIip\fR

The domain name 
.I fqdn
has IP address 
.IR ip .
You can list as many as 128 IP addresses for the same name.


-\fIfqdn\fR:\fIip\fR

This type of line is used by programs that automatically edit 
.I data
to temporarily exclude addresses of overloaded or dead machines.
The line is ignored.

.RI # comment

Comment line. The line is ignored.

.SH Client differentiation

.I pickdns
can return results
that depend on the location of the client.

.B pickdns-data
supports the following data lines:

%\fIlo\fR:\fIipprefix\fR

IP addresses starting with 
.I ipprefix
are in location 
.IR lo .

.I lo
must be at most two bytes long:
e.g., 
.IR uk .

+\fIfqdn\fR:\fIip\fR:\fIlo\fR

The domain name 
.I fqdn
has IP address
.I ip
for clients in location
.IR lo .
You can list as many as 128 IP addresses for the same name and location.
This eliminates all non-location +\fIfqdn\fR:\fIip\fR
lines
from the point of view of those clients.

-\fIfqdn\fR:\fIip\fR:\fIlo\fR

Ignored.
