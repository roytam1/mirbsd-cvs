djbdns is a collection of Domain Name System tools. It includes
several components:

• The dnscache program is a local DNS cache. It accepts recursive
  DNS queries from local clients such as web browsers. It collects
  responses from remote DNS servers.
• The tinydns program is a fast, UDP-only DNS server. It makes local
  DNS information available to the Internet.
• The pickdns program is a load-balancing DNS server. It points
  clients to a dynamic selection of IP addresses.
• The walldns program is a reverse DNS wall. It provides matching
  reverse and forward records while hiding local host information.
• The rbldns program is an IP-address-listing DNS server. It uses DNS
  to publish a list of IP addresses, such as RBL or DUL.
• The dns library handles outgoing and incoming DNS packets. It can
  be used by clients such as web browsers to look up host addresses,
  host names, MX records, etc. It supports asynchronous resolution.
• The dnsfilter program is a parallel IP-address-to-host-name converter.
• The dnsip, dnsipq, dnsname, dnstxt, and dnsmx programs are simple
  command-line interfaces to DNS.
• The dnsquery and dnstrace programs are DNS debugging tools.
• The dnscache-conf program sets up dnscache to work at once with
  root servers from ${FLAVOURS}
• The axfrdns program can be used to exchange data with BIND servers.
  It is capable of AXFR and IXFR protocols.
• dnscache can "ban" specified A and AAAA records from being returned,
  rendering domains/hosts which resolve to these unusable, returning
  NXDOMAIN. This can be used to "ban" wildcard second-level domains,
  such as those used by Verisign Corp.
• This version has been extensibly patched to enable coexisting IPv4
  and IPv6 transports and connect to nameservers using either protocol
  and, courtesy of Fefe, allows listening on multiple addresses at once.
• Several IPv6-related bugs and Fefe's shortcomings have been fixed, on
  top of djbdns-1.05-test27.diff.bz2 plus other patches.
• SRV records are supported… somewhat.
• 0.0.0.0 is no longer parsed as [::] but as [::FFFF:0.0.0.0] ☺
• The patch to merge identical outgoing requests, and the patch to
  allow caching SOA responses, from http://www.your.org/dnscache/
  have been merged.
• For IPv6 reverse DNS, only the ip6.arpa. domain is used.
