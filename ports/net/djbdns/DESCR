djbdns is a collection of Domain Name System tools. It includes
several components:

• The dnscache program is a local DNS cache. It accepts recursive
  DNS queries from local clients such as web browsers. It collects
  responses from remote DNS servers.
• The tinydns program is a fast, UDP-only DNS server. It makes local
  DNS information available to the Internet.
• The pickdns program is a load-balancing DNS server. It points
  clients to a dynamic selection of IP addresses.
• The walldns program is a reverse DNS wall. It provides matching
  reverse and forward records while hiding local host information.
• The rbldns program is an IP-address-listing DNS server. It uses DNS
  to publish a list of IP addresses, such as RBL or DUL.
• The dns library handles outgoing and incoming DNS packets. It can
  be used by clients such as web browsers to look up host addresses,
  host names, MX records, etc. It supports asynchronous resolution.
• The dnsfilter program is a parallel IP-address-to-host-name converter.
• The dnsip, dnsipq, dnsname, dnstxt, and dnsmx programs are simple
  command-line interfaces to DNS. 
• The dnsquery and dnstrace programs are DNS debugging tools.
• The dnscache-conf programme sets up dnscache to work at once with
  root servers from ${FLAVOURS}
• The axfrdns program can be used to exchange data with BIND servers.
  It is capable of AXFR and IXFR protocols.
• dnscache can "ban" specified A records (dnscachet6 can also ban AAAA
  records) from being returned, rendering domains/hosts which resolve
  to these unusable, returning a NXDOMAIN. This can be used to "ban"
  wildcard second-level domains, such as those used by Verisign Corp.
• Most xxx programmes have an xxxt6 counterpart for IPv6 transport.
• This version also contains extensive patches to the IPv6 transport
  resolver to enable it as client to communicate with IPv4 nameservers.
• In addition to that, the IPv6 nameserver (tinydnst6) can handle
  listening on IPv4 addresses in this version, and, courtesy of fefe,
  listening on multiple addresses at once.
• Several IPv6-related bugs and fefe's shortcomings have been fixed.
• dnscachet6 can now listen on an IPv6 instead of IPv6 address too,
  but not (yet) multiple addresses. It uses IPv4/IPv6 transport on
  the outgoing side in both cases, though.
• 0.0.0.0 is no longer parsed as [::] but as [::FFFF:0.0.0.0] ☺

In the future, the xxxt6 binaries will replace the respective xxx
binaries with no way to get the v4-only behaviour back. We’re almost
there, as most of them now handle IPv4 transport as well, even on
the BSDs, as opposed to Fefe’s versions.
