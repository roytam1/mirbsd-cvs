Installing sendfile on MirOS/BSD
--------------------------------

See sendfiled(8) for information on configuring sendfiled.

To use sendfiled with inetd modify /etc/inetd.conf:

# simple asynchronous file transfer
saft    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/sendfiled sendfiled

Example configuration files has been installed in 
${PREFIX}/share/examples/sendfile. To get started quickly
you can copy this over to /etc.
Otherwise you can use the shellscripts sfconf and sfdconf to
edit or create the configuration files for sendfile.

cp -Rp ${PREFIX}/share/examples/sendfile /etc

Don't forget to create the spool directories. Default is
/var/spool/sendfile

mkdir /var/spool/sendfile
