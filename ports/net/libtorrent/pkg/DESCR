LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix, with
a focus on high performance and good code. The library differen-
tiates itself from other implementations by transfering directly
from file pages to the network stack. On high-bandwidth connec-
tions it is able to seed at 3 times the speed of the official
client.

The client uses ncurses and is ideal for use with screen or
dtach. It supports saving of sessions and allows the user to add
and remove torrents.
