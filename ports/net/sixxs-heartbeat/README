The SixXS heartbeat client is obsolete: there is an AICCU/AYIYA (wtf?)
thing in testing.
The SixXS heartbeat client also was broken on recent systems, so we
have removed it. Please do not ask us to have it come back.

For the curious: there is a quick-hack SixXS heartbeat protocol client
available (well, it's actually damn stable and good working):
$ cvs -d _anoncvs@thor.66h.42h.de:/cvs \
> co -PA contrib/samples/codesnippets/hbclient

Please read the enclosed instructions.
