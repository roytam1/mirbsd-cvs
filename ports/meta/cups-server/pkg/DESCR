This is a meta-package. It does not include any files by itself, but it
helps you to easily install CUPS with some printer drivers.

If you build this from source, you need not even install the resulting
package because everything will have been installed as a build-time
dependency. For binary packages, installing the package will pull in all
the other packages as a run dependency.

For most of the supported printer models, you will need a PPD file. Go
to http://www.linuxprinting.org/, search for your printer model,
download the PPD and put it in ${PREFIX}/share/cups/model.
