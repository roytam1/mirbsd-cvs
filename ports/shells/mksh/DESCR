mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn
shell (pdksh), a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely si‐
milar to the original AT&T Korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh
derivate currently being actively developed.  It includes bug
fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern,
robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
mksh has UTF-8 support (e.g. in the emacs editing mode); R38b
corresponds to OpenBSD 4.5-current ksh (without GNU bash-like
$PS1 and fancy character classes).  The code has throughoutly
been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards compli‐
ance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibi‐
lity to other modern shells – as well as a couple of its own)
have been placed.

A sample ~/.mkshrc is included in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/mksh/
