Multibyte issues: mksh vs zsh; x='mäh'
echo ${x::1} → ‘m’	echo ${x[0,1]} → ‘m’
echo ${x::2} → ‘mä’	echo ${x[0,2]} → ‘m�’
echo ${x::3} → ‘mäh’	echo ${x[0,2]} → ‘mä’

Seems as if zsh tries each octet if it’s a valid multibyte char
first; since ä=C3,A4 and C3=U+EFC3 (OPTU-16), this fails miserably.
All calls to mbrtowc with 1 as third argument are broken, at least.

Fixing would involve several man-hours, if not days, of work, since
the entire multibyte code was written with broken (unportable) as-
sumptions in mind. The code also reeks of unsafe string functions.


For this reason, the zsh MirPort will have multibyte support
disabled.
