Audacious is a fork of Beep Media Player, which is a fork of XMMS.
Audacious supports a huge number of different formats. It even
supports exotical formats from gaming consoles and new formats like
ALAC which are currently not supported by any other player for UNIX.

This package contains the player binary. To do anything useful, you
also need the audacious-plugins package.
