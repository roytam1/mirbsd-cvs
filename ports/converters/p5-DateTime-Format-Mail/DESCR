RFCs 2822 and 822 specify date formats to be used by email. This module
parses and emits such dates.

RFC2822 (April 2001) introduces a slightly different format of date than
that used by RFC822 (August 1982). The main correction is that the
preferred format is more limited, and thus easier to parse
programmatically.
