If you are upgrading from libiconv-1.9.1-2 or older:
The includes and libraries have moved from ${PREFIX}/lib
and ${PREFIX}/include to ${PREFIX}/giconv/{lib,include}
respectively.

To continue using your old applications which were linked
against libiconv without rebuilding, put symbolic links
into ${PREFIX}/lib/ from your preferred implementation:

MirOS-current, not retaining file names:
 * libiconv.so.2.2   -> /usr/lib/libiconv.so.4.4
 * libcharset.so.1.0 -> ${PREFIX}/giconv/lib/libcharset.so.1.0

Darwin, retaining file names:
 * libiconv.*.dylib   -> /usr/lib/libiconv.*.dylib
 * libcharset.*.dylib -> /usr/lib/libcharset.*.dylib

Other operating systems, retaining file names:
 * libiconv.so*   -> ${PREFIX}/giconv/lib/libiconv.so*
 * libcharset.so* -> ${PREFIX}/giconv/lib//libcharset.so*
