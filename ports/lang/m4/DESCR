GNU 'm4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor.
It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some extensions (for
example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros). GNU
'm4' also has builtin functions for including files, running shell
commands, doing arithmetic, etc. GNU Bison needs GNU 'm4' to properly
operate. GNU Autoconf needs GNU 'm4' for generating 'configure'
scripts, but not for running them.
