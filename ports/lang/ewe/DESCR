This is Lunix Ewe, an embedded Java™ virtual machine derived
from Ewesoft Linux® Ewe.

This fork has been created to bypass the time until the next
generation of embedded VMs, namely Eve, is ready to use, and
is not intended to infringe Ewesoft or their products in any
way whatsoever. It’s a fun project, done to improve portabi-
lity of CacheWolf and fix some bugs. We would be glad if our
changes could be merged back into the main project.

• ewe-${VERSION}
