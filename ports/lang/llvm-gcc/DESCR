The GCC C Front-End for LLVM is based upon Apple GCC, which
in turn is based upon FSF GCC 4.2.1 (GNU GPLv2).

This port comes with the C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++
languages enabled and can be considered experimental. Support
for MidnightBSD is mostly missing; MirBSD 10uA3 and up are the
only tested targets (Darwin might work). MirBSD 10 (release)
*will not work*. C++ sucks.

This port is quite hacky, expect rough edges.
