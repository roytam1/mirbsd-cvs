This is Tcl8.4, an embeddable tool command language. It is an easy-to-use
scripting language with clear syntax. Because it is a scripting
language, programs written in it are easily portable to other operating 
systems. Feature include networking functionality, string and number
manipulation, and regular expression support.

A rich set of extensions to the language are available, as well.

The best way to get started with Tcl is to read ``Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit, 4th ed'' by John K. Ousterhout, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-13-038560-3.

A full set of manual pages is also provided with this package.

Note: the "clock" regression test is known to fail on systems which,
      contrary to POSIX but following certain countries' laws, honour
      leap seconds; this is probably due to a deficiency in TCL. I've
      tried to fix it by preventing, to TCL, we have UTC in time_t,
      but this turned out to be infeasible, so I left it as is.
