| In order to compile ports which break for the reason
|		"uses C++, but no CXX installed"
| use the following syntax to compile them:
|	# make install clean MKC_EGCC=yes
|
| Please do not try to compile the base system with ecgs!
| (This is the reason why MKC_EGCC=yes in /etc/mk.conf.local
|  is deprecated and not officially supported!)
