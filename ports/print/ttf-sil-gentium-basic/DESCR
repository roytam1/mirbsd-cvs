Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic are font famililes based on
the original Gentium design, but with additional weights. The
"Book" family is slightly heavier. Both families come with a
complete regular, bold, italic and bold italic set of fonts.

The supported character set, however, is much smaller than for the
main Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic
Latin and Latin-1 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of
the more commonly used extended Latin characters, with miscel-
laneous diacritical marks, symbols and punctuation. A much more
complete character set will be supported in a future version of
the complete Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts are intended as a
way to provide additional weights for basic font users without
waiting until the complete Gentium character set is finished.

In particular, these fonts do not support:
 * Full extended Latin IPA
 * Complete support for Central European languages
 * Greek
 * Cyrillic

There are also some other limitations of the Basic fonts:
 * They are not completely metric-compatible with the full Gentium
   family (some glyphs may have different widths, although changes
   have been minimal)
 * There is no kerning
 * There are no "Alt" versions, or ones with low-profile
   diacritics
 * The default stacking style for some diacritic combinations does
   not match Vietnamese-style conventions (although this is
   available through a OpenType/Graphite feature)
 * No support for TypeTuner.

There are, however, some wonderful new features that are still
missing from the main Gentium family:
 * Bold!
 * Bold Italic!
 * The slightly-heavier Book family!
 * OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement!
 * A few useful OpenType and Graphite features
 * Support for a few more recent additions to Unicode and the SIL PUA
 * Character assignments are updated to conform to Unicode 5.1

In particular, the Basic fonts support a subset of the smart font
features that the Doulos SIL font supports. Those features are:
 * Capital Eng alternates
 * Literacy alternates
 * Capital Y-hook alternate
 * Capital N-left-hook alternate
 * Modifier apostrophe alternate
 * Modifier colon alternate
 * Open o alternate
 * Vietnamese-style diacritics

More detail on the features can be seen in the Doulos SIL
Technical Documentation.

The font sources are available in the source package and directly
on the upstream project website.
