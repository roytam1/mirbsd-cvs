Truetype one-size-only font mimicking the classic DEC VT220 one,
with scanlines. Cyrillic added, as the author is russian or so…

According to the site, use “size 20 on Mac/Linux, size 15 in
Windows” for correct look: “You will probably have to enter
these numbers manually because they are not in the standard
size grid.” This appears to be a 20px / 15pt size. On MirBSD,
I’ve had luck with the following two commands:
• xterm -fa 'Glass TTY VT220' -fs 21
• xterm -fa 'Glass TTY VT220' -fs 22
Since ‘-fs’ specifies a point size, according to TFM, it’s
probably dependent on the dpi of the display.

Unfortunately, this still leaves us with the quest to get an
RGB colour code for amber (and Radioactive Green) as the PNG
on the website is anti-aliased…
