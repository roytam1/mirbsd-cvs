This port packages some sample and contributional files that
used to lie within /usr/share/misc/contrib/ until MirOS #7.

In addition to that, here is a central place to get the SSH
public keys and PGP fingerprints of the MirOS developers as
well as the project’s gzsig(1) keys.

There are several more files, Unicode and keyboard layouts'
tables, conversion tables, vendor branch allotments, etc.
