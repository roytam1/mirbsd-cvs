AquaTerm is a Mac OS X plotting front end (grahics terminal) written
using Objective-C and the Cocoa API.

It allows other applications to display vector graphics and images using
a simple API. This is useful for displaying graphics generated by old
code natively in Aqua. AquaTerm will let you print and save the output
as PDF or EPS files.

You connect to AquaTerm through an "adapter", a small code snippet that
will have to be linked with your old code. If you are lucky, an adapter
is already available for download, otherwise you'll have to write your
own adapter using one of the examples provided.

This package contains the perl adapter for Aquaterm.
