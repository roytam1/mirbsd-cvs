These are the games you'd normally expect to come
with the BSD base system installation, thrown out
for space and code cleanliness reasons.

The "potentially offensive fortunes" data file is
stored in clear text. Beware, Americans!

Special fortune cookie files found on the internet
have been added to your delight. Feel free to drop
me a message if you want more, or even maintain an
additional file inside our CVS.

On all operating systems except OpenBSD and Interix,
fortune cookie files are converted to UTF-8 standard.
