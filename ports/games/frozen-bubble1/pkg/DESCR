An amazingly cute game of popping bubbles.  Full-featured, colorful
animated penguin eye candy, 100 levels of 1p game, hours and hours
of 2p game, a level-editor, 3 professional quality 20-channels musics,
15 stereo sound effects, 7 unique graphical transition effects.

If you need networked (LAN or Internet) multi-player, install the
frozen-bubble 2.0 port; otherwise, this one is much lighter on the
system resources.
