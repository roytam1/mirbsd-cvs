The Midnight Commander is a directory browsing tool which bears a
certain remote resemblance to John Socha's Norton Commander for DOS,
as well as the free-/shareware clone Volkov Commander for DOS.
It is feature packed:

	o Built in Virtual File System: manipulate remote files
	  systems through the ftp protocol. Midnight Commander's own
	  mcfs protocol has been disabled for security reasons.
	  Browse tar, compressed tar files, rpm, zip,
	  cpio, lha and rar files with a single click.

	o Built in Samba client library.

	o All of the Midnight Commander operations work with the virtual
	  file system, enabling you to do complex tasks.

	o Key combinations for "vt220" and "wsvt25" terminals are fixed.
	  Fixing "screen" would be a bit harder, because it sends the
	  same keycodes for the F5 and F6 keys.

	o User files are saved in ~/.etc/mc/ instead of ~/.mc/ now.

	o Someone should really do some security auditing.
