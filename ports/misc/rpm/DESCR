RPM is a package management system based on top of cpio.
It supports digital signatures, source and binary packages,
complex dependencies handling, complex installation scripts
and a lot more.

It has its own macro language, and is well-spread in
the Linux world.

The package database used to be set to /var/db/rpm by default,
to conform with hier(7), but has changed to ${LOCALBASE}/db/rpm.

Sample ~/.rpmmacros for signing packages:
| %_signature pgp
| %_pgp_name 0xCAFEBABE
| %_pgp_path /home/foo/.pgp
Please make sure ports/security/pgp+ (pgp-2.6.3in-3) is installed.
