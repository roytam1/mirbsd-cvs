The ipop2d, ipop3d, and imapd daemons should be invoked by your
/etc/inetd.conf file with lines such as:

  imap	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd
  imap	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd
  pop2	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop2d	ipop2d
  pop2	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop2d	ipop2d
  pop3	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d
  pop3	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d


To use SSL as default transport you need to add the lines below to
/etc/inetd.conf:

  imaps	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd
  imaps	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd 	imapd
  pop3s	stream	tcp4	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d
  pop3s	stream	tcp6	nowait	root	${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d	ipop3d

You also need to install files containing an RSA certificate and
private key to ${SYSCONFDIR}/ssl/ipop3d.pem and
${SYSCONFDIR}/ssl/imapd.pem. See ssl(8) for information on how to
do this.
