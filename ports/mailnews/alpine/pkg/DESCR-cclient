c-client is a common API for accessing mailboxes. It is used
internally by the popular PINE mail reader as well as the
University of Washington's IMAP server.

This package also contains the licencing information and other
documentation for the UW c-client / daemons / mailutil bundle,
as well as Alpine, Pico and Pilot.
