Web Alpine is the web-based component of the Alpine Mail System.
It rests on the same distributed email technology behind Alpine,
but is accessible from almost any browser on the World Wide Web.

Web Alpine uses TCL to provide the programmatic interface between
the Alpine-provided message store and the cgi-served web pages.
