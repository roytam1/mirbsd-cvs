Alpine is a fast, easy to use tool for reading, sending, and
managing electronic messages. It was designed specifically with
novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate
the needs of "power users" as well. Alpine uses Internet message
protocols (e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and runs on Unix
and PCs. Alpine is based on the Pine Message System, which was
also developed at the University of Washington. Alpine can be
learned by exploration and the use of context-sensitive help. The
user experience is highly customisable through the use of the
Alpine Setup command.

If you want to use the spell checking feature of Alpine, install
ports/textproc/ispell and set the environment variable SPELL to
"${PREFIX}/bin/ispell -l".
