| the configuration files /etc/pine.conf and /etc/pine.conf.fixed
|
| For using the PGP facility, please refer to the sample pinerc file
| in the documentation directory; for S/MIME you might want to add
|	alias pine='${PREFIX}/bin/pine.smime.init \
|		${PREFIX}/bin/pine -d0'
| to your ~/.profile in order to have an easier call facility, and
| read in ${PREFIX}/bin/pine.smime how to set it up.
