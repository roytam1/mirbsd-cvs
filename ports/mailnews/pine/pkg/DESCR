Pine is a tool for reading, sending, and managing electronic messages. It
was designed specifically with novice computer users in mind, but can be
tailored to accommodate the needs of "power users" as well. Pine uses
Internet message protocols (e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and runs
on Unix and PCs. This package does not include the IMAP, POP2 and POP3
daemons, the mailutil tool, pico or pilot (which are subpackages).

If you want to use the spell checking feature of pine, install ispell and
set the environment variable SPELL to "${PREFIX}/bin/ispell -l".

An optional configuration file "pine.conf" can be put into ${SYSCONFDIR} to set
system wide defaults. The format of this file is identical to the .pinerc
file that is auto-generated by pine in your home directory.

Also included in dot.pinerc.pgp.sample are example entries needed to add to
your .pinerc to activate the pgp add on scripts pgpdecode, pgpencode, and
pgpsign. Furthermore, there is an S/MIME plug-in (or rather, wrapper for
sendmail) with installation instructions in ${PREFIX}/bin/pine.smime (in
form of shell comments).

Warning: do not use the "plaintext" flavour unless ABSOLUTELY necessary;
the default settings allow the use of plaintext passwords over SSL/TLS.

Flavors:
	ldap		build with support for LDAP
	plaintext	allow unencrypted passwords
