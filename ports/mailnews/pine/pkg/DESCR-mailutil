This is the IMAP4rev1 server utility from the University of Washington,
and two local delivery agents. To use tmail with sendmail, use
| Mlocal,        P=${PREFIX}/libexec/tmail, F=LlsDFMAw5:/|@qPrn67E, S=EnvFromL/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
|                T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix, E=\r\n,
|                A=tmail $u
and do a chmod 4111 ${PREFIX}/libexec/tmail. dmail can be used as-is
within procmail or local "prog" mailer scripts (see ports/mail/bmf).

This package also includes a contributed perl script to fix damaged
MBX format mailboxes.
