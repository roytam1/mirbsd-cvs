"Joe is world-famous Wordstar like text editor."
		-- Sourcefrog

joe is the professional freeware ASCII text screen editor for
UNIX(R). It makes full use of the power and versatility of UNIX,
but lacks the steep learning curve and basic nonsense you have
to deal with in every other UNIX editor. joe has the feel of
most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are reminiscent of
WordStar and Turbo-C. joe is much more powerful than those edi-
tors, however. joe has all of the features a UNIX user should
expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update
optimizations (joe is fully useable at 2400 baud), simple in-
stallation, and all of the UNIX-integration features of vi.

jupp is a customisation of joe which provides easy conversion
for former PC users as well as powerfulness for programmers,
while not doing things "automagically" (word wrap, indenting,
highlighting, to name a few). It can even hex edit files now.

This is joe-3.x-jupp<y>, a GNU GPL version 1 licenced fork
of the current state-of-the-art JOE editor from Sourceforge,
with Joe H. Allen himself starting development again after
over eight years. The MirOS fork has added UTF-8 Support for
non-LOCALE-aware operating systems (such as OpenBSD and older
versions of MirOS), the "jupp" flavour, not doing tab comple-
tion in the search and replace dialogues, as well as -Wall
-Werror fixes, numerous bug and security fixes. It also con-
tains an extension to visibly display tabs and spaces, and
has a cleaned up, extended and beautified options menu, and
better charset support in general.
