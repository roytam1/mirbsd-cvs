SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access
without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a
standalone command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to
administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to
use the SQLite library.

This version is probably obsolete; see ports/databases/sqlite for the
version currently maintained upstream. These two can, however, be in-
stalled in parallel, due to API versioning. Migration is painless.
