Lemon is an LALR(1) parser generator for C or C++. It does the same
job as bison and yacc. But lemon is not another bison or yacc
clone. It uses a different grammar syntax which is designed to reduce
the number of coding errors. Lemon also uses a more sophisticated
parsing engine that is faster than yacc and bison and which is both
reentrant and thread-safe. Furthermore, Lemon implements features
that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for
use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or
embedded controllers.
