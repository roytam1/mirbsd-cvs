The GNU Grub is a boot loader which supports loading
multiboot-capable kernels, as well as the Linux kernel.
It's the standard boot loader for the GNU operating system
under the HURD kernel, but can be used as boot manager for
other operating systems as well.

This version has a hacked-in support to additionally enable
booting MirBSD kernels over the network (but NOT from disc).

The supplied files are:
 - nbgrub:	For NBI systems such as Etherboot
 - pxegrub:	For PXE boot enabled computers
		You should probably use /usr/mdec/pxeboot instead.
 - stage*:	For floppy discs, install with:
		# cat stage1 stage2 >/dev/rfd0c
		(or install stage2 from within GNU OS)
 - grub.info:	The original documentation
