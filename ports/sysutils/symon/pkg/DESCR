symon is a lightweight system monitor that measures cpu, memory,
interface and disk statistics every 5 seconds. This information is
then spooled over "the network" to symux for further processing.

The port will yield 3 packages:
symon-mon-${VSN}.tgz : symon daemon and manual.
symon-mux-${VSN}.tgz : symux daemon, manual and rrd creation script.
symon-${VSN}.tgz     : all of the above rolled into a single package
