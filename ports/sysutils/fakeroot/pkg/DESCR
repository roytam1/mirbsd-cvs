Gives a fake root environment

This package is intended to enable something like:
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
i.e. to remove the need to become root for a package build.
This is done by setting LD_PRELOAD to libfakeroot.so,
which provides wrappers around getuid, chown, chmod, mknod,
stat, and so on, thereby creating a fake root environment.

fakeroot requires SYSV IPC to operate.

On MirBSD, with the source tree checked out, use the command chain
│ $ cd /usr/src
│ $ make -f distrib/dbins/Makefile.sub obj
│ $ make -f distrib/dbins/Makefile.sub depend
│ $ make -f distrib/dbins/Makefile.sub LDSTATIC=
│ $ sudo make -f distrib/dbins/Makefile.sub install
to install dynamically linked versions of all relevant tools; be
sure to only do that if your /usr is not on a separate filesystem!
