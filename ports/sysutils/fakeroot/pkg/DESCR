Gives a fake root environment

This package is intended to enable something like:
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
i.e. to remove the need to become root for a package build.
This is done by setting LD_PRELOAD to libfakeroot.so,
which provides wrappers around getuid, chown, chmod, mknod,
stat, and so on, thereby creating a fake root environment.

fakeroot requires SYSV IPC to operate.
