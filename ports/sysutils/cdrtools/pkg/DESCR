The cdrtools software includes programs to create and/or extract
ISO 9660 filesystems, verify their integrity, and write them to
disc.

This package contains the following software:
  cdda2wav (digital CD audio extraction program)
  cdrecord (CD recording program)
  devdump (dump a device or file in hex)
  isodebug (analyze or list an ISO-9660 image)
  isodump (analyze or list an ISO-9660 image)
  isoinfo (analyze or list an ISO-9660 image)
  isovrfy (verify an ISO-9660 image)
  readcd (read data CDs, write to DVD-RAM and copy
    Solaris boot CDs)
  mkhybrid (create hybrid ISO-9660/HFS images)
  mkisofs (create CD images)

mkhybrid is defunct since mkisofs 2.0 came out, and mkisofs
is part of the MirOS base installation since MirOS #8. This
version of the port, however, comes with both mkisofs and
mkhybrid, because it should be usable on Darwin too, and
because MirOS will replace the in-base mkisofs with makefs(8).
