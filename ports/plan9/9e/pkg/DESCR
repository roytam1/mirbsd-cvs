9e is a very simple program designed to explode
Third Edition Plan 9 and at least some Inferno archives.

Usage Summary:

	$ 9e [options] <file> ...

	If no file is named on the command line, standard
	input is assumed. Note that the input file must be
	a decompressed archive (decompress with gzip).

	* -h: dump headers only
	* -v: dump file names and sizes while extracting
	* -r: specify alternate root directory
	* -?: help
