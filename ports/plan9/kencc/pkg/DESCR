This is the Plan 9 compiler suite, taken from Inferno.
It also comes with iar (an ar(1) lookalike),
mk (some sort of make(1) tool), mkext (archiver)
and associated utilities, but no libraries.

Note: this port uses /usr/bin/cpp as C Preprocessor,
which is "always there", instead of hardcoding Reiser
CCCP which is there on MirOS only. See ${PREFIX}/bin/9cpp.

You can't do anything useful with this compiler unless
you write your own startup files and libraries. 8l can
only generate COFF (-H1) and some even weirder oformats.
