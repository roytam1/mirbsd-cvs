- language packs - while the default Opera download comes with
  US-English only, a variety of languages are available on the
  Opera website (some of which are (about to be) packaged with
  this port) or third-party sites. This port adds:
  * LÃ«tzebuergsch
- customisable skins; this port comes with the two default skins and:
  * Minimalist Native
- instant toggling of image and documents settings
- full-screen and kiosk modes

Issues:
- there is a soft dependency on redhat_motif
- opera 8 might segfault with your old opera 7 configuration, in that
  case remove ~/.opera and start over
- no SunJDK, IBMjava under MirOS BSD for now, since we can only run
  the sunjdk/jre-1.3 stuff in the linux emulation (currently, Java
  is disabled in the port, but may come back once requested, but
  then only with the sunjre-1.3-linux stuff)
- read the install notice ("pkg_info -D opera") before using
