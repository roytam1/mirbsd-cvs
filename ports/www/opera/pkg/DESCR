Issues:
– there is a soft dependency on redhat_motif
– opera 8 might segfault with your old opera 7 configuration, in that
  case remove ~/.opera and start over
– no SunJDK, IBMjava under MirOS BSD for now, since we can only run
  the sunjdk/jre-1.3 stuff in the linux emulation (currently, Java
  is disabled in the port, but may come back once requested, but
  then only with the sunjre-1.3-linux stuff)
– read the install notice (“pkg_info -D opera”) before using
