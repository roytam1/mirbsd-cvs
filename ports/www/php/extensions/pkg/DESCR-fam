Filesystem Alteration Monitor module for PHP.

FAM monitors files and directories, notifying interested 
applications of changes.
A PHP script may specify a list of files for FAM to monitor 
using the functions provided by this extension.
The FAM process is started when the first connection from 
any application to it is opened. It exits after all 
connections to it have been closed.
