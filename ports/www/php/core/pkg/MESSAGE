To finish the installation, enable the php5 module with:
    ${PREFIX}/sbin/phpxs -s

To enable parsing of PHP scripts, add the following to
${WWW_PREFIX}/conf/httpd.conf:
    
    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

Copy the config file below into ${PHP_CONFIG_FILE}
${PREFIX}/share/doc/php/php.ini-recommended

The .ini file scan directory is ${PHP_CONFIG_PATH}/php/

Don't forget that the default httpd chroots into
${WWW_PREFIX} by default, so you may need to create support
directories such as ${WWW_PREFIX}/tmp for PHP to work correctly.
