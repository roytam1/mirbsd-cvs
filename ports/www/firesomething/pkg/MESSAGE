If you encounter strange problems related to bookmarks, dwnloads, window
placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that
you try creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem
before filing bugs.

In order to create a new profile, start Firesomething with the the
-profilemanager switch, e.g. firesomething -profilemanager.

If firesomething doesn't start at all, first try and remove compreg.dat,
xpti.dat and extensions/Extensions.rdf in your profile directory or just
remove the old profile:

    rm -r ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile-dir> ~/.firefox/<profile-dir>
