This is a port which gets the sources of the well-known graphical
browser Mozilla(TM) Firefox(TM), based upon Netscape Navigator,
patches and installs it.

Due to the Trademark Licencing, this is not free software and
thus packages cannot be distributed.

This browser looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins
${LOCALBASE}/firesomething/plugins
and ${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins.

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) altogether set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the
environment.
