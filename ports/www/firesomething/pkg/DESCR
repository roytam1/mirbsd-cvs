The Mozilla Firefox project is a redesign of Mozilla's browser
component, written using the XUL user interface language and designed
to be cross-platform.

This version looks for plugins in:
• ~/.mozilla/plugins
• ${LOCALBASE}/firesomething/plugins
• ${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins

It has been extended with the MirOS ca-certificates bundle.

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) altogether set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the
environment.
