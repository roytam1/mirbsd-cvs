Snownews is a text mode RSS/RDF newsreader. 
It supports RSS 1.0 feeds that comply with the W3C RDF specification 
and also supports Radio Userland's RSS 0.91 and 2.0 versions.

The program depends on ncurses for the user interface and uses libxml2
for XML parsing. ncurses must be at least version 5.0. 
It should work with any version of libxml2.
