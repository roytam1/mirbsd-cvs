Pdlzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to
the one of lzip, bzip2 or gzip.

Pdlzip uses the lzip file format; the files produced by pdlzip are
(hope)fully compatible with lzip-1.4 or newer. Pdlzip is in fact a
permissively licensed implementation of the lzip data compressor,
intended for those who can't distribute (or even use) GPL licensed Free
Software. (The name of pdlzip comes from "public domain lzip"). The full
licence terms are included in the binary.

Pdlzip only includes a man page and a README file. For information about
the lzip file format see the online manual of lzip at:
	http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/manual/lzip_manual.html

The lzip file format is designed for data sharing and long-term
archiving, taking into account both data integrity and decoder
availability:
* The lzip format provides very safe integrity checking and some data
  recovery means. The lziprecover program can repair bit-flip errors
  (one of the most common forms of data corruption) in lzip files, and
  provides data recovery capabilities, including error-checked merging
  of damaged copies of a file.
* The lzip format is as simple as possible (but not simpler). The lzip
  manual provides the source code of a simple decompressor along with a
  detailed explanation of how it works, so that with the only help of
  the lzip manual it would be possible for a digital archaeologist to
  extract the data from a lzip file long after quantum computers
  eventually render LZMA obsolete.
* Additionally the lzip reference implementation is copylefted, which
  guarantees that it will remain free forever.

A nice feature of the lzip format is that a corrupt byte is easier to
repair the nearer it is from the beginning of the file. Therefore, with
the help of lziprecover, losing an entire archive just because of a
corrupt byte near the beginning is a thing of the past.

Pdlzip is also able to decompress legacy lzma-alone (.lzma) files.
Lzma-alone is a very bad format; it is essentially a raw LZMA stream. If
you keep any lzma-alone files, it is advisable to recompress them to
lzip format. Lziprecover can convert some lzma-alone files to lzip
format without recompressing.

Pdlzip is written in C.

Pdlzip includes public domain (de)compression code from the LZMA SDK
(Software Development Kit) written by Igor Pavlov. As with XZ-Utils,
this is acceptable because of the following permission grant:

# Note on material marked as PD or derived from such in here:
#
# We got an explicit copyright licence from Igor Pavlov, the
# original author of, according to several sources, any such
# material, in both xz-utils and pdlzip (WTFPL-like):
#
# From: Igor Pavlov
# Message-ID: <BFE18C67668F4A56A0965B2115DAB7FA@igor2>
# Subject: Re: LZMA SDK and legalities of public domain
# […]
# I even don't want to think about these restrictions, countries,
# Berne Convention and so on.
# You can use the code. [in projects under OSS licences that
# include code from LZMA SDK (context: mails from me and Lasse)]
# No restrictions from me.
#
# Lasse Collin, around <20111118225931.4b7e60e3@tukaani.org>, also
# confirms this, adding an interpretation of this as WTFPL and
# explicitly permits sublicencing and to “change the license”; he
# also confirms the authenticity of Igor Pavlov’s answer.

Note that Lasse Collin is the author of XZ-Utils. Note further that
lzlib and lzip do not have this issue because they are a from-scratch
implementation developed completely by Antonio Diaz Diaz. MirBSD will
use lzlib soon, and GPL-compatible applications should use lzip.
