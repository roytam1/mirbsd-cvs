# To be run on ork with openjdk-8-jre-headless installed.

# Requirements:
#	./pem/*.[0-9]	→ certs (PEM format)
#	./dsc/*		→ descriptions (we assume every one has one!)
#	keytool		→ Sun JDK version (or OpenJDK IcedTea), not GCJ
# We also assume certs with the same hash have the same description
# and trust (this is not necessarily true, but WFM for now).
# For old keytool versions, remove ECC certificates from pem/ and keep
# only DSA and RSA certificates (not necessary for recent versions)
