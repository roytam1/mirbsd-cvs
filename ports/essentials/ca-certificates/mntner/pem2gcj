# To be run in a squeeze chroot, gcj-4.4-jre-headless installed
#
# Requirements:
#	./pem/*.[0-9]	→ certs (PEM format)
#	./dsc/*		→ descriptions (we assume every one has one!)
#	gkeytool-4.4	→ GCJ version (not Sun or OpenJDK/IcedTea)
# We also assume certs with the same hash have the same description
# and trust (this is not necessarily true, but WFM for now).
# See 00-NOTES for a list of ECC certificates to drop from pem/ first.
