# To be run on ork with gcj-4.8-jre-headless installed.
#
# Requirements:
#	./pem/*.[0-9]	→ certs (PEM format)
#	./dsc/*		→ descriptions (we assume every one has one!)
#	gkeytool-4.8	→ GCJ version (not Sun or OpenJDK/IcedTea)
# We also assume certs with the same hash have the same description
# and trust (this is not necessarily true, but WFM for now).
# If you get an error during creation or listing, drop the last cert
# added before that (in my case, 8c24b137.0) from the pem/ directory.
