This port packages some X.509 CA certificates which
come with the MirOS base installation, for use e.g.
with OpenBSD and Mac OSX. This bundle is a superset
of the Debian package with the same name, plus some
CA certificates from M*zilla, cURL, Opera, rootsupd
(Microsoft), Apple and others; invalid certificates
have been removed.
It's endorsed by the Lynx developers and users.

Recent SetEnv.{sh,csh} automatically point the path
correctly to the data directory, if found. Program-
mes employing OpenSSL will use the SSL_CERT_DIR en-
vironment variable set thusly. This package is com-
patible with both OpenSSL 1.x and 0.9.x hashes.

Other programmes must be configured to set the cer-
tificate store to: ${PREFIX}/share/ca-certificates/

Java™ programmes can use the “keystore.jks” file in
the very same directory: -storepass ‘changeit’ – It
contains RSA, DSS and ECC certificates now. This is
created with OpenJDK 7 nowadays. The “keystore.gcj”
file contains one for GCC’s J2RE (without ECC certs
or those causing an error), with an empty string as
storepass.

GnuTLS users and others requiring a single file set
the configuration/environment setting SSL_CERT_FILE
to: ${PREFIX}/share/ca-certificates/pkbundle.pem

M*zilla users can use the shipped certdata.txt file
to generate certdata.c for their nssckbi module. To
get new names, replace, e.g. with sed(1):
-e 's/CKT_NETSCAPE_VALID/CKT_NSS_NOT_TRUSTED/g'
-e 's/CKT_NETSCAPE_TRUST_UNKNOWN/CKT_NSS_MUST_VERIFY_TRUST/g'
-e 's/\(CK[OT]_\)NETSCAPE_/\1NSS_/g'
