This port packages some X.509 CA certificates which
come with the MirOS base installation, for use e.g.
with OpenBSD and Mac OSX. This bundle is a superset
of the Debian package with the same name, plus some
certificates from M*zilla/cURL and Opera, where in-
valid certificates have been removed. It's endorsed
by the Lynx developers and users.

Recent SetEnv.{sh,csh} automatically point the path
correctly to the data directory, if found. Program-
mes employing OpenSSL will use the SSL_CERT_DIR en-
vironment variable set thusly.

Other programmes must be configured to set the cer-
tificate store to ${PREFIX}/share/ca-certificates/
