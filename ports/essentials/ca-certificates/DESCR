This port packages some X.509 CA certificates which
come with the MirOS base installation, for use e.g.
with OpenBSD and Mac OSX. This bundle is a superset
of the Debian package with the same name, plus some
CA certificates from M*zilla, cURL, Opera, rootsupd
(Microsoft), Apple and others; invalid certificates
have been removed.
It's endorsed by the Lynx developers and users.

Recent SetEnv.{sh,csh} automatically point the path
correctly to the data directory, if found. Program-
mes employing OpenSSL will use the SSL_CERT_DIR en-
vironment variable set thusly. This package is com-
patible with both OpenSSL 1.x and 0.9.x hashes.

Other programmes must be configured to set the cer-
tificate store to: ${PREFIX}/share/ca-certificates/

Java™ programmes can use the “keystore.jks” file in
the very same directory: -storepass ‘changeit’ – It
contains RSA, DSS and ECC certificates now. This is
created with OpenJDK 6 and tested with Sun J2SDK 5.
The “keystore.gcj” file contains one for GCC’s J2RE
with an empty string storepass.

GnuTLS users and others requiring a single file set
the configuration/environment setting SSL_CERT_FILE
to: ${PREFIX}/share/ca-certificates/pkbundle.pem

M*zilla users can use the shipped certdata.txt (or,
for now, certdata.c but we’ll probably stop putting
that into the package shortly).
