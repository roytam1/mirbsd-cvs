This is the portable MirMake version of MirOS make(1)
and its support libraries, header files, make scripts,
as well as the support tools binstall aka install(1),
lndir(1) from XFree86®, lorder(1), mkdep(1), readlink(1),
and tsort(1), in their respective MirOS versions.

It runs on any BSD, and is supposed to run on GNU/Linux,
Apple Mac OSX, and Microsoft Interix 3.5 as well. There
is a “BSD compatibility” library, libmirmake. MirMake is
also part of the FreeWRT Embedded GNU/Linux (µClibc) ADK
(Appliance Development Kit) buildsystem’s host tools.
