This is the portable MirMake version of MirOS make(1).

It runs on any BSD, and is supposed to run on GNU/Linux,
Apple Mac OSX, and Microsoft Interix 3.5 as well. There
is a "BSD compatibility" library, libmirmake. MirMake is
also part of the FreeWRT Embedded GNU/Linux (ÂµClibc) ADK
(Appliance Development Kit) buildsystem's host tools.
