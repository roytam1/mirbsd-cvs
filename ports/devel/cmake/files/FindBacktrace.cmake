# $MirOS$
#
# - Find provider for backtrace(3)
# Checks if OS supports backtrace(3) via either libc or custom library.
# This module defines the following variables:
#  BACKTRACE_HEADER       - header file needed for backtrace(3)
#  BACKTRACE_INCLUDE_DIR  - where to find ${BACKTRACE_HEADER}
#  BACKTRACE_LIBRARIES    - libraries needed for backtrace
#  BACKTRACE_FOUND        - is set if and only if backtrace(3) support detected
