GNU autotools tend to be incompatible from release to release.

metaauto is an attempt at alleviating the problem: it provides actual
scripts, such as autoconf, that will try to call the right tool based
on a few environment variables, such as AUTOCONF_VERSION and
AUTOMAKE_VERSION. The return status is 1 if not set, unless (mostly to
keep compatible to the original OpenBSD metaauto) AUTOCONF_NOTSET_OK
or AUTOMAKE_NOTSET_OK (respectively) are set to 1.
