distcc is a program to distribute builds of C, C++, Objective C or
Objective C++ code across several machines on a network. distcc should always 
generate the same results as a local build, is simple to install and use, and 
is usually much faster than a local compile. 

distcc does not require all machines to share a filesystem, have synchronized 
clocks, or to have the same libraries or header files installed. They can even
have different processors or operating systems, if cross-compilers are 
installed.
