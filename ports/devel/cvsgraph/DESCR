CvsGraph is a utility to make a graphical representation of all
revisions and branches of a file in a CVS/RCS repository. It has
been inspired by the 'graph' option in WinCVS, but I could not
find a stand-alone version of this graph code. So, it was time to
write one.

CVSNT is supported as of version 1.5.1, including mergepoints.

CvsGraph is officially supported by ViewVC (previously known as
ViewCVS) as of version 0.8.

I'm glad to announce that the new stable version of FreeBSD-
CVSweb 3.0.0 has CvsGraph support built in, zero patching
necessary. Feel free to update the information on this in the
CvsGraph page.
