+This option is typically used when you have multiple users sharing

+To use this feature, create a directory to hold the checked-out
+source tree, set it to a private group, and set up the directory
+such that files created under it inherit the gid of the directory.
+On BSD systems, this occurs automatically. On SYSV systems and
+GNU/Linux, the sgid bit must be set on the directory for this.
+The users who are to share the checked out tree must be placed in
+that group which owns the directory.

+Note that the sharing of a single checked-out source tree is very
