This module provides a few convenience methods for testing warning based
code.

    warning_is BLOCK STRING, TEST_NAME
        Tests that BLOCK gives exactly the one specificated warning. The
        test fails if the BLOCK warns more then one times or doesn't warn.
    warnings_are BLOCK ARRAYREF, TEST_NAME
        Tests to see that BLOCK gives exactly the specificated warnings. The
        test fails if the BLOCK warns a different number than the size of
        the ARRAYREF would have expected.
    warning_like BLOCK REGEXP, TEST_NAME
        Tests that BLOCK gives exactly one warning and it can be matched to
        the given regexp.
    warning_like BLOCK STRING, TEST_NAME
        Tests whether a BLOCK gives exactly one warning of the passed
        category.
    warnings_like BLOCK ARRAYREF, TEST_NAME
        Tests to see that BLOCK gives exactly the number of the specificated
        warnings and all the warnings have to match in the defined order to
        the passed regexes.
