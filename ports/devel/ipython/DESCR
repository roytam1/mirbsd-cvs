The goal of IPython is to create a comprehensive environment for
interactive and exploratory computing.
To support, this goal, IPython has two main components:
 * An enhanced interactive Python shell. (See below.)
 * An architecture for interactive parallel computing.

IPython provides a replacement for the interactive Python interpreter
with extra functionality, including persistent input history,
readline-based name completion and comprehensive object
introspection. It also allows easy access to the pdb debugger and
Python profiler, as well as the system shell.

You need devel/py-pexpect for irunner as additional dependency.
