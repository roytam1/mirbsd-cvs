This module in an fully object-oriented implementation of a simple n-ary
tree. It is built upon the concept of parent-child relationships, so
therefore every Tree::Simple object has both a parent and a set of
children (who themselves may have children, and so on). Every
Tree::Simple object also has siblings, as they are just the children of
their immediate parent.

It is can be used to model hierarchal information such as a filesystem,
the organizational structure of a company, an object inheritance
hierarchy, versioned files from a version control system or even an
abstract syntax tree for use in a parser. It makes no assumptions as to
your intended usage, but instead simply provides the structure and means
of accessing and traversing said structure.
