Params::Util provides a basic set of importable functions that makes
checking parameters a hell of a lot easier.

While they can be (and are) used in other contexts, the main point
behind this module is that the functions both Do What You Mean, and Do
The Right Thing, so they are most useful when you are getting params
passed into your code from someone and/or somewhere else and you can't
really trust the quality.
