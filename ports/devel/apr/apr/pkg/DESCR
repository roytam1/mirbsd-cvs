The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create
and maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and
consistent interface to underlying platform-specific implementations.
The primary goal is to provide an API to which software developers may
code and be assured of predictable if not identical behaviour regardless
of the platform on which their software is built, relieving them of the
need to code special-case conditions to work around or take advantage of
platform-specific deficiencies or features.

This product includes software developed by The Apache Software
Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).

Portions of this software were developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign.

This software contains code derived from the RSA Data Security Inc. MD5
Message-Digest Algorithm.
