The OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a window system independent toolkit for
writing OpenGL programs. It implements a simple windowing application
programming interface (API) for OpenGL. GLUT is designed for
constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs. While GLUT is
well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL
applications, GLUT is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications
requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native
window system toolkits like Motif.

freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the original OpenGL
Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library.

GLUT (and hence freeglut) allows the user to create and manage windows
containing OpenGL contexts on a wide range of platforms and also read
the mouse, keyboard and joystick functions.
