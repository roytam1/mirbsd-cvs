XSane is a graphical scanning frontend. It uses the SANE-library to talk
to scanners. This means that XSane does not support any scanners itself.
Here you can find out which scanners are supported by the SANE-library.

XSane is designed for acquiring images with scanners (there are other
devices like cameras and videodevices supported by SANE, but XSane is
not designed for that purpose). You can scan to file, do a photocopy,
create a fax, create and send a mail and start XSane from the GIMP as
gimp plug in.
