.Dt BSD.PORT.MK 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bsd.port.mk
.Nd ports tree master Makefile fragment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd \&.include <bsd.port.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
holds all the standard routines used by the ports tree.
Some variables and targets are for its internal use only.
The rest is documented here.
.Pp
Other BSD variants, as well as older versions of
.Nm bsd.port.mk ,
include other targets and variables.
Conversion methods are outlined here.
.Pp
This is not quite complete; a few variables and targets are not yet documented.
Mostly because undocumented stuff has fuzzy semantics, and it hasn't been
decided yet how to define it.
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width do-configure
.It Ar {build,run,all}\-dir\-depends
Print all dependencies for a port in order to build it, run it,
or both.
The output is formatted as package specification pairs, in a form suitable
for
.Xr tsort 1 .
.It Ar full\-{build,run,all}\-depends
Print all dependencies a package depends upon for building, running,
or both, as a list of package names.
.It Ar {build,lib,run}\-depends\-list
Print a list of first level package specifications a port depends as
build dependencies, library dependencies, or run dependencies.
.It Ar print\-{build,run}\-depends
User convenience target that displays the result of
.Ar full\-{build,run}\-depends
in a more readable way.
.It Ar {pre,do,post}\-*
Most standard targets can be specialized according to a given port's needs.
If defined,
the
.Ar pre\-*
hook will be invoked before running the normal action;
the
.Ar do\-*
hook will be invoked instead of the normal action;
the
.Ar post\-*
hook will be invoked after the normal action.
Specialization hooks exist for
.Ar build ,
.Ar configure ,
.Ar distpatch ,
.Ar extract ,
.Ar fake ,
.Ar fetch ,
.Ar install ,
.Ar package ,
.Ar patch ,
.Ar regress .
See individual targets for exceptions.
.It Ar addsum
Complete the ${CHECKSUM_FILE} record of checksums with files that have been
added since
.Ar makesum .
Complain if anything does not match.
.It Ar build , Ar all
Default target.
Build the port.
Essentially invoke
.Bd -literal
env \-i ${MAKE_ENV} ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${MAKE_FLAGS} \e
	\-f ${MAKE_FILE} ${ALL_TARGET}
.Ed
.It Ar build\-depends
Verify the ports mentioned in
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS ,
by checking the corresponding packages are actually installed,
and install the missing ports by recursing through the ports tree.
Invoked right after creating the working directory.
.It Ar checkpatch
Debugging version of the
.Ar patch
target that simulates invoking
.Xr patch 1 .
.It Ar checksum
Check distribution archives and distribution patches control sum against
the results recorded in ${CHECKSUM_FILE},
using the cryptographic signature utilities defined.
Normally ${ALLFILES}
are checksummed, unless
.Ev IGNOREFILES
is set to a list of files to ignore.
Invoking
.Ar checksum
with REFETCH=true
will try to fetch a version with the correct checksum from the
.Ox
main archive site in the case of a checksum mismatch.
.Ev NO_CHECKSUM
can be used to avoid all checksumming steps.
.It Ar clean
Clean ports contents.
By default, it will clean the work directory.
It can be invoked as
mmake clean=\*(aq[depends bulk work fake flavours dist install sub package packages]\*(aq.
.Bl -tag -width packages
.It Va work
Clean work directory.
.It Va bulk
Clean bulk cookie.
.It Va depends
Recurse into dependencies.
.It Va flavours
Clean all work directories.
.It Va dist
Clean distribution files.
.It Va install
Uninstall package.
.It Va package
Remove package file (and copies in ${CDROM_PACKAGES} and ${FTP_PACKAGES}).
.It Va readmes
Clean files generated through the
.Ar readme
targets (html files).
.It Va sub
With
.Va install
or
.Va package ,
clean subpackages as well.
.It Va packages
Short-hand for
.Sq sub package .
.El
.It Ar clean\-depends
Short hand for mmake clean=depends.
.It Ar configure
Configure the port.
Might be a void operation.
Unless overridden, configure creates the ${WRKBUILD}
directory, runs ${SCRIPTDIR}/configure if it exists,
and runs whatever configuration methods are recorded in
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE .
.It Ar depends
Check all the port's dependencies, that is:
.Ar build\-depends ,
.Ar lib\-depends ,
.Ar run\-depends ,
.Ar regress\-depends .
.It Ar describe
Prints a one-line index entry of the port, suitable for
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/INDEX .
.It Ar distclean
Short-hand for mmake clean=dist.
.It Ar distpatch
Apply distribution patches only.
See
.Ar patch
and
.Ev PATCH_CASES
for details.
.It Ar extract
Extract the distribution files under
.Pa ${WRKDIR}
(but see
.Ev EXTRACT_ONLY ) .
Refer to
.Ev EXTRACT_CASES
for a complete description.
Do not use
.Ev pre\-extract
and
.Ev do\-extract
hooks.
.It Ar fake
Do a fake port installation, that is, simulate the port installation under
${WRKINST}.
There is no
.Ev do\-fake
and
.Ev post\-fake
hooks.
.Ar fake
actually uses
.Ev pre\-fake ,
.Ev pre\-install ,
.Ev do\-install
and
.Ev post\-install .
Described in a separate section below.
.It Ar fetch
Fetch the distribution files and patchfiles, using ${FETCH_CMD}.
Each file of the
.Ev DISTFILES
and
.Ev PATCHFILES
lists is retrieved, if necessary, from the list of sites in
.Ev MASTER_SITES .
If a filename ends with a
.Sq :0
to
.Sq :9
extension, it will be retrieved from
.Ev MASTER_SITES0
to
.Ev MASTER_SITES9
instead.
The ports framework uses
.Pa ${DISTDIR}/${DIST_SUBDIR}
(aliased to
.Pa ${FULLDISTDIR} )
to cache the ports distribution files and patch files.
Note that this framework is also used by mirroring scripts,
which will also retrieve
.Ev SUPDISTFILES ,
to fill with supplementary distribution files which are not needed for
every configuration.
See
.Ev ALLFILES ,
.Ev CDROM_SITE ,
.Ev DISTDIR ,
.Ev DISTFILES ,
.Ev DIST_SUBDIR ,
.Ev FETCH_CMD ,
.Ev FETCH_MANUALLY ,
.Ev FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES ,
.Ev FULL_DISTDIR ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES0 , ... ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES9 ,
.Ev PATCH_FILES ,
.Ev SUPDISTFILES ,
.Ev REFETCH .
.It Ar install
Install the package after building.
See the description of THE FAKE FRAMEWORK
for the non-intuitive details of the way
.Ar {pre,do,post}\-install
hooks are actually used by the ports tree.
.It Ar lib\-depends
Verify that the library dependencies a port needs are actually there,
by checking the library specifications.
.It Ar lib\-depends\-check
Verify that the
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
hold all shared libraries used for the port.
See
.Xr library\-specs 7 .
.It Ar license\-check
Check that
.Ev PERMIT_PACKAGE_*
settings match:
if any dependency has a more restrictive setting, warn about it.
This warning is advisory, because the automated license checking cannot
figure out which ports were used only for building and did not taint
the current port.
.It Ar link\-categories
Create symbolic links in other directories that correspond to the port's
.Ev CATEGORIES .
Note that this does not affect bulk package building, since those links
don't appear in the upper-level Makefiles.
See also
.Ar unlink\-categories .
.It Ar makesum
Create the ${CHECKSUM_FILE} list of recorded checksums by running the
cryptographic fingerprints (hashes) rmd160, tiger, sha1, sha256 and md5
on ${ALLFILES} minus ${IGNOREFILES}.
.Ev NO_CHECKSUM
can be used to avoid all checksumming steps.
.It Ar manpages\-check
Verify that
.Xr makewhatis 8
can do a correct job with the port's manpages.
.It Ar package
Build a port package (or packages in
.Ev MULTI_PACKAGES
cases) from the fake installation.
Involves creating packaging information from templates
(see
.Ev COMMENT ,
.Ev SED_PLIST ,
.Ev SUBST_VARS
among others) and invoking
.Xr pkg_create 1
for each package in the
.Ev MULTI_PACKAGES
list.
If ${PERMIT_PACKAGE_FTP} is set to
.Sq Yes ,
copies built packages into ${FTP_PACKAGES}, using
hard links if possible.
If ${PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM} is set to
.Sq Yes ,
copies built packages into ${CDROM_PACKAGES}, using
hard links if possible.
.It Ar patch
Apply distribution and
.Ox
specific patches.
Because of historical accident,
.Ar patch
does not follow the exact same scheme other standard targets do.
Namely,
.Ar patch
invokes
.Ar pre\-patch
(if defined),
.Ar do\-patch ,
and
.Ar post\-patch ,
but the default
.Ar do\-patch
target invokes
.Ar distpatch
directly.
So, if the
.Ar do\-patch
target is overridden, it should still begin by calling
mmake distpatch, before applying
.Ox
specific patches.
Accordingly, the exact sequence of hooks is:
.Ar pre\-patch ,
.Ar do\-distpatch ,
.Ar post\-distpatch ,
.Ar do\-patch ,
.Ar post\-patch .
If
.Pa ${PATCHDIR}
exists, the files described under
.Ev PATCH_LIST
will be applied under
.Ev WRKDIST .
.It Ar readmes
Create an html description of packages, including comments, description,
and dependencies.
.It Ar rebuild
Force rebuild of the port.
.It Ar regress
Run regression tests for the port.
Essentially depend on a correct build and invoke
.Bd -literal
env \-i ${MAKE_ENV} ${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${REGRESS_FLAGS} \e
	\-f ${MAKE_FILE} ${REGRESS_TARGET}
.Ed
.Pp
If a port needs some other ports installed to run regression tests,
use
.Ev REGRESS_DEPENDS .
If a port needs special configuration or build options to enable regression
testing, define a
.Sq regress
.Ev FLAVOUR .
.It Ar regress\-depends
Verify packages needed for regression tests, using the same scheme as
.Ar build\-depends .
Only invoked when regression tests are run, or explicitly through
.Ar depends .
.It Ar reinstall
Force reinstallation of a port, by first cleaning the old installation.
.It Ar repackage
For rebuilding of the packages of a port, by first removing the old packages.
.It Ar run\-depends
Verify the ports mentioned in
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS ,
by checking the corresponding packages are actually installed,
and install the missing ports by recursing through the ports tree.
Invoked right before installing the package.
.It Ar show
Invoked as mmake show=name, show the contents of ${name}.
Invoked as mmake show="name1 name2 ...",
show the contents of ${name1} ${name2} ...,
one variable value per line.
Mostly used from recursive makes, or to know the contents of another
port's variables without guessing wrongly.
.It Ar unlink\-categories
Remove symbolic links in other directories that correspond to the port's
.Ev CATEGORIES .
See also
.Ar link\-categories .
.It Ar update\-patches
Create or update patches for a port, using
.Xr diff 1
between
.Pa file
and
.Pa file.orig ,
based on
.Pa file.orig
existence.
In order to generate a patch, the original file needs to be named
.Pa file.orig
and
.Pa file
edited.
After the target is invoked, the patches are placed under the
patches/ directory.
It moves existing patches from
.Pa patch\-file
to
.Pa patch\-file.orig
.It Ar update\-plist , Ar plist
Update the packing lists for a port, using the fake installation and the
existing packing lists.
.Ar update\-plist
should produce mostly correct
.Pa PLIST ,
.Pa PFRAG.shared
and
.Pa PFRAG.no\-shared
files, handling shared libraries, GNU
.Xr info 1
files, setuid files, and empty directories.
It moves existing files to
.Pa PLIST.orig ,
.Pa PFRAG.shared.orig
and
.Pa PFRAG.no\-shared.orig .
If the generated lists include files and directories that shouldn't be
included, comment these like this:
.Bd -literal
@comment unwanted-file
@comment @dirrm unwanted-dir
.Ed
.Pp
Subsequent calls to
.Ar update\-plist
will automatically recognize and handle such lines correctly.
.Pp
.Ar update\-plist
does not handle flavour situations yet, so beware.
.El
.Sh USER SETTINGS
These variables should not be modified by individual ports.
You can add them to the command line, set them as (exported)
environment variables, or put them into
.Xr mmake.cfg 5
to tune various options.
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev BATCH
Set to
.Sq Yes
to avoid ports that require user-interaction
Use in conjunction with
.Ev INTERACTIVE
to simplify bulk-package builds.
.Pq See IGNORE .
.It Ev BIN_PACKAGES
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
the
.Ar package
target will trust a package built in the repository to be up-to-date,
and will not rebuild it if the work directory is absent.
See also
.Ev BULK ,
.Ev TRUST_PACKAGES .
.It Ev BULK
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
successful package builds and installations will clean
their working directories, after invoking
any targets mentioned in BULK_TARGETS.
Can be set on a per-${PKGPATH} basis.
For instance, setting BULK_misc/screen=No
will override any BULK=Yes passed on the command line.
See
.Ev BULK_COOKIES_DIR ,
.Ev BIN_PACKAGES ,
.Ev TRUST_PACKAGES .
.It Ev BULK_COOKIES_DIR
Used to store cookies for successful bulk-package builds, defaults to
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/Bulk .
.It Ev CDROM_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for a CDROM (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM) will be placed
(default: ${PKGREPOSITORY}/CDROM)
.It Ev COPTS
Supplementary options appended to ${CFLAGS} for building.
Since most ports ignore the COPTS convention, they are actually told to use
${CFLAGS} ${COPTS} as CFLAGS.
.It Ev CXXOPTS
Supplementary options appended to ${CXXFLAGS} for building.
.It Ev ECHO_MSG
Used to display
.Sq ===\*(Gt Configuring for foo
and similar informative messages.
Override to turn off, for instance.
.It Ev FETCH_CMD
Command used to fetch distribution files for this port.
Defaults to
.Xr ftp 1 .
Actually, this is
.Dq ftp Fl o .
Can be used to go through excessively paranoid firewalls.
.It Ev FETCH_SYMLINK_DISTFILES
Set to
.Sq No
to copy distribution files off
.Ev CDROM_SITE
instead of symlinking them.
.It Ev FTP_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for ftp (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_FTP) will be placed
(default: ${PKGREPOSITORY}/FTP)
.It Ev INTERACTIVE
Set to
.Sq Yes
to skip all non-interactive ports.
Used in conjunction with
.Ev BATCH
to simplify bulk-package builds.
.It Ev NO_CHECKSUM
Set to
.Sq Yes
to avoid
.Ar checksum ,
.Ar makesum ,
and
.Ar addsum
actions entirely.
Beware of the full implications of this mechanism, namely that it disables
entirely the basic authentication mechanisms of the ports tree.
.It Ev NO_DEPENDS
Don't verify build of dependencies.
Do not use in any ports Makefile.
This is only meant as a user convenience when, e.g., you just want to browse
through a given port's source and do not wish to trigger the build of
dependencies.
.It Ev NO_IGNORE
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
avoid ignoring a port for the usual reasons.
Use, for instance, for fetching all distribution files, or for fixing a
broken port.
See also
.Ev IGNORE .
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
Path to package installation records.
Defaults to
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Ev PKGREPOSITORY
Location for packages built (default ${PORTSDIR}/Packages).
.It Ev REFETCH
If set to true,
.Ar checksum
will analyze ${CHECKSUM_FILE}, and try retrieving files with the correct
checksum off
.Pa ftp.openbsd.org ,
in the directory
.Pa /pub/OpenBSD/distfiles/$cipher/$value/$file .
.It Ev REPORT_PROBLEM
A command which is run when a port build fails during a recursive run,
i.e. when running
.Cm mmake
in a subdirectory or for a whole category.
The default is to abort the build; during bulk builds, the port name is
written to a file in
.Ev ${PORTSDIR}
called
.Pa Failed ,
and the build is continued at the next port.
.It Ev SUDO
If set to
.Xr sudo 8
in
.Xr mmake.cfg 5 ,
the ports tree will only invoke root's privileges for the parts that
really require it.
.It Ev TEMPLATES
Base location for the templates used in the
.Ar readmes
target.
.It Ev TRUST_PACKAGES
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
dependency mechanisms will assume the database of installed packages is
correct.
See also
.Ev BIN_PACKAGES ,
.Ev BULK .
.It Ev WARNINGS
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
add
.Ev CDIAGFLAGS
to
.Ev CFLAGS
and
.Ev CXXDIAGFLAGS
to
.Ev CXXFLAGS .
.El
.Sh PORT MAKEFILE VARIABLES
Note that some variables are marked as
.Sq read-only ,
which means that they shouldn't ever be changed.
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev show
Invoked as mmake show=name, show the contents of ${name}.
Invoked as mmake show="name1 name2 ...", show the contents of
${name1} ${name2} ...,
one variable value per line.
.It Ev ALLFILES
List of all files that need to be retrieved by
.Ar fetch ,
with master site selection extension removed.
Read-only.
.It Ev ALL_TARGET
Target used to build software.
Default is
.Sq all .
Can be set to empty, to yield a package's default target.
.It Ev ARCH
Current machine architecture (read-only).
.It Ev AUTOCONF
Location of the autoconf binary if needed.
Defaults to autoconf (though mmake autoreconf might be more appropriate).
.It Ev AUTOCONF_DIR
Where to invoke autoconf if ${CONFIGURE_STYLE} includes autoconf.
Defaults to ${WRKSRC}.
.\" AUTOCONF_DIR should probably be a list, and be renamed to AUTOCONF_DIRS ?
.It Ev AUTOCONF_NEW
For
.Sq Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE Ns = Ns No autoconf ,
specify which version of autoconf to use.
.Sq no
selects the older version 2.13,
.Sq yes
selects the current version from the 2.5x series.
If autoconf must be run manually,
.Ev MODGNU_AUTOCONF_DEPS
can be used to specify what packages to depend upon.
.It Ev AUTOCONF_VERSION
Manually set the autoconf version to use.
Please note that this variable is deprecated in MirPorts, and
.Ev AUTOCONF_NEW
.Pq see above
should be used.
.It Ev AUTOGEN
For
.Sq Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE Ns = Ns No autogen ,
set the name of the
.Pa autogen.sh
file to call.
The default is to use a standard version from the MirPorts infrastructure.
.It Ev BROKEN
Define only for broken ports, set to reason the port is broken.
See also
.Ev NO_IGNORE .
.It Ev BSD_INSTALL_{PROGRAM,SCRIPT,DATA,MAN}[_DIR]
Macros passed to mmake and configure invocations.
Set based on corresponding INSTALL_* variables.
.It Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
List of other ports the current port needs to build correctly.
Each item has the form
.Sq [legacy]:[pkgspec]:directory[,\-subpackage][,flavour ...][:target] .
.Sq target
defaults to
.Sq install
if it is not specified.
.Sq legacy
used to be a file to check.
The ports tree now uses
.Sq pkgspec
instead, as a package that must be installed prior to the build.
.Sq directory
is set relative to ${PORTSDIR}.
.Sq subpackage
is an optional subpackage name, to install instead of the default main
package name.
.Sq flavour ...
is a comma separated list of flavours.
By default, the dependency will build the default flavour.
Build and lib dependencies are checked at the beginning of the extract stage.
.Pp
Build dependencies that are not the default
.Ar package
or
.Ar install
target will be processed in a subdirectory of the working directory,
specifically, in ${WRKDIR}/directory.
.It Ev BULK_FLAGS
Flags to pass to build each target in
.Ev BULK_TARGETS .
.It Ev BULK_TARGETS
Targets to run after each bulk package build before cleaning up the
working directory.
Empty defaults.
Can be set on a per-${PKGPATH} basis, e.g.,
BULK_TARGETS_${PKGPATH}=...
.It Ev BZIP2
Name of the bzip2 binary.

.Pq with Ar autoconf
Do not run
.Cm autoheader .
Use this for broken ports if autoheader aborts with an error message.
.It Ar automake
.Cm automake
may need to be rerun.
Please note that you still must do this manually.
Otherwise, automake will be explicitly disabled.
.It Ar autogen
Run
.Pa autogen.sh

\&.endif
.Ed
.It Ev EXTRACT_CASES
In the normal extraction stage (when
.Ev EXTRACT_ONLY
is not empty), this is the contents of a case statement, used to extract files.
Fragments are automatically appended to extract tar and zip
archives, so that the default case is equivalent to the following shell
fragment:
.Bd -literal

.It Ev FETCH_MANUALLY
Some ports' distfiles cannot be fetched automatically for licensing reasons.
In this case, set
.Ev FETCH_MANUALLY
to a list of strings that will be displayed, one per line, e.g.,
.Bd -literal
FETCH_MANUALLY= "You must fetch foo\-1.0.tgz"

For use by ports which
fetch dynamically generated archives that can't be checksummed.
Avoid using IGNOREFILES whenever possible.
.It Ev LIB_DEPENDS
Libraries this port depends upon.
These are also always build dependencies, and added to
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
automatically, if required.

.It Ev IS_INTERACTIVE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if port needs human interaction to build.

Porters should strive to minimize IS_INTERACTIVE ports, by using
FLAVOURS for multiple choice ports, and by postponing human intervention
to package installation time.
.It Ev LIBTOOL
Location of the libtool binary for ports that set
.Ev USE_LIBTOOL
(default: ${LOCALBASE}/bin/libtool).

Supplementary locations from which distribution files and patchfiles are
retrieved.
.It Ev MCZ_FETCH
For _CVS_DISTF operation, i.e. if one of
.Ev CVS_DISTREPO
or
.Ev SVN_DISTPATH
is set, control the way how these
VCS distfiles are fetched.
This variable affects all distfiles, i.e.\&
.Ev _CVS_DISTF , _CVS_DISTF0 , ... , _CVS_DISTF9 .
.Pp
Possible values are:
.Bl -tag -width lzma
.It Va \&No
Directly fetch from the VCS and compress using
.Xr mpczar 1 .
.Pp
This is the default.
.It Va Yes
Fetch from the appropriate MASTER_SITES, which
is initialised to default to ${_MASTER_SITE_MIRBSD}.
.It Va LZMA
Append the suffix
.Dq .lzma
to the
.Ev _CVS_DISTF ,
and fetch it from the appropriate MASTER_SITES, which
is initialised to default to ${_MASTER_SITE_MIRBSD}.
.Pp

by the master site administrator, and due to use of a
different compressor than the
.Pa mpczar.z
helper, it is not guaranteed to be reproducible.
.It Va xz
Append the suffix
.Dq .xz
to the
.Ev _CVS_DISTF ,
and fetch it from the appropriate MASTER_SITES, which
is initialised to default to ${_MASTER_SITE_MIRBSD}.
.Pp
Note that the distfile has to be recompressed manually
by the master site administrator, and due to use of a
different compressor than the
.Pa mpczar.z
helper, it is not guaranteed to be reproducible.
.El
.It Ev MESSAGE

Defaults to ${PKGDIR}/MESSAGE if this file exists.
Leave empty if no message is needed.
.It Ev MODGNU_RECURSE_DIRS
If a port uses more than one
.Cm configure
script, set this to all directories that contain one.
Copies
.Pa config.guess

.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
is
.Ar autoconf ,
autoconf is also called in the given directories,
and so on for autogen, autoheader, MirLibtool conversion, etc.
.It Ev MODGNU_TYPESCAN
Set this to the names of functions where the configure script
scans for types of its arguments, to prevent bogus warnings
such as:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
conftest.c:141: error: conflicting types for \*(aqrecv\*(aq
/usr/include/sys/socket.h:451: error: previous declaration of \*(aqrecv\*(aq was here
.Ed
.Pp
These warnings are grepped from the
.Pa config.log

.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree
is always appended.
These specifications are rooted at
.Pa ${WRKINST} ,
and are subject to
.Ev SUBST_VARS
substitution, to ease
.Pa ${PREFIX}
independence.
This feature is primarily intended for large, interconnected ports,
such as the kde suite, where a base package sets up a large, extra
directory hierarchy that would make the manual checking of packing lists
tedious.
.It Ev MULTI_PACKAGES
Set to a list of package extensions for ports that create multiple packages.
See
.Qq Flavours and multi-packages
below.
.It Ev NOT_FOR_ARCHS

.It Ev PATCHORIG
Suffix used by
.Ar patch
to rename original files, and
.Ar update\-patches
to re-generate
.Pa ${PATCHDIR}/${PATCH_LIST}
by looking for files using this suffix.
Defaults to
.Pa .orig .
For a port that already contains
.Pa .orig
files in the ${DISTFILES},
set this to something else, such as
.Pa .pat.orig .
See also
.Ar distpatch ,
.Ev DISTORIG .
.It Ev PATCH_CASES
In the normal distpatch stage (when
.Ev PATCHFILES
is not empty), this is the contents of a case statement, used to apply
distribution patches.
Fragments are automatically appended to handle compressed
patches, so that the default case is equivalent to the following shell
fragment:
.Bd -literal
set \-e
cd ${FULLDISTDIR}
for patchfile in ${_PATCHFILES}
do
    case $$patchfile in
	*.bz2)
	  bzip2 \-dc $$patchfile \*(Ba ${PATCH} ${PATCH_DIST_ARGS};;
	*.Z\*(Ba*.gz)

Full list of options used while applying port's patches.
.It Ev PATCH_CHECK_ONLY
Set to Yes by the

stage will output extra debug information.
.It Ev PATCH_DIST_ARGS
Full list of options used while applying distribution patches.

The corresponding packages will be built at
.Ar install
stage, and
.Xr pkg_add 1
will take care of installing them.
.It Ev SED_PLIST
Pipeline of commands used to create the actual packing list from the
PLIST template (usually ${PKGDIR}/PLIST).
.Nm
appends to it substitution commands corresponding to the port's
FLAVOUR and variables from SUBST_VARS.
${SED_PLIST} is invoked as a pipeline after inserting PFRAG.shared fragments.
.It Ev SCRIPTDIR
Location for scripts related to the current port (default: scripts.${ARCH}
or scripts).
.It Ev SVN_DIST*
Enables an operation mode where the distfile is
fetched from Subversion.
The following variables can be set by the user:
.Bl -tag -width SVN_DISTFILE
.It Ev SVN_DISTDIR
Name of the top-level directory to check out to.
Optional (derived from the basename of
.Ev SVN_DISTPATH ) .
If this is only a dash
.Pq Sq - ,
a single-file checkout is done.
.It Ev SVN_DISTFILE
The file name prefix.
Optional (derived from the basename of
.Ev SVN_DISTDIR ) .
.It Ev SVN_DISTPATH
Repository to check out from (full path).
.It Ev SVN_DISTREV
Revision to check out.
.El
.Pp
For the full documentation for these variables, see
.Xr cvs\-distfiles 7 .
.Pp
.Ev WRKDIST
is set automatically to ${WRKDIR}/${SVN_DISTDIR}.
.Ev PKGNAME
defaults to ${SVN_DISTFILE}\-${SVN_DISTREV}\-${DASH_VER}.
.It Ev SUBPACKAGE
Set to the sub package suffix when building a package in a multi-package port.
Read-only.
Used to test for dependencies or to adjust the package name.
.It Ev SUBST_VARS
Make variables whole values get substituted to create the actual package
information.
Always holds
.Ev ARCH ,
.Ev FLAVOUR_EXT ,
.Ev HOMEPAGE ,
.Ev MACHINE_ARCH ,
.Ev MAINTAINER ,
.Ev PREFIX ,
and
.Ev SYSCONFDIR .
The special construct
.Sq ${FLAVOURS}
can be used in the packing-list to specify the current list of dash
separated flavours the port is compiled with (useful for cross-dependencies
in
.Ev MULTI_PACKAGES ) .
Add other
variables as needed.
.It Ev SUPDISTFILES
Supplementary files that need to be retrieved under some specific
circumstances.
For instance, a port might need architecture-specific files.
.Ev SUPDISTFILES
should hold a list of all distribution files and patchfiles that are not
always needed, so that a mirror will be able to grab all files, or that
.Ar makesum
will work.
Having an overlap between
.Ev SUPDISTFILES
and
.Ev DISTFILES ,
.Ev PATCHFILES
is admissible, and in fact, expected, as it is much simpler to build
an error-free list of files to retrieve in that way.
See the xanim port for an example.
.It Ev SYSCONFDIR
Location for ports system configuration files.
Defaults to
.Pa /etc ,
should never be set to
.Pa /usr/local/etc .
.It Ev SYSTRACE_FILTER
Location of the systrace filter file which is the basis for a port's
actual systrace policy file.
Defaults to
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/systrace.filter .
.It Ev SYSTRACE_SUBST_VARS
List of variables used in ${SYSTRACE_FILTER} that will be substituted
by their real value when creating the systrace policy file.
Always holds
.Ev WRKOBJDIR ,
.Ev PORTSDIR ,
and
.Ev DISTDIR .
.It Ev TAR
Name of the tar binary.
.It Ev UNZIP
Name of the unzip binary.
.It Ev USE_CXX
Set to
.Sq Yes
if the port needs a C++ compiler to build.
On systems without a C++ compiler, this shows a fatal error.
.It Ev USE_GMAKE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if gnu make (${GMAKE}) is needed for correct behavior of this port.
.It Ev USE_LIBTOOL
Set to
.Sq Yes
if libtool is required for correct behavior of this port.
Adds correct dependencies, and passes LIBTOOL environment variable to
scripts invocations.
.It Ev USE_MOTIF
Set to
.Sq any
if port works with any version of motif;
.Sq lesstif
if port requires lesstif to work;
.Sq openmotif
if ports requires openmotif to work.
The
.Sq any
setting creates an extra flavour choice of
.Sq lesstif .
See also
.Ev MOTIFLIB
.It Ev USE_SYSTRACE
Set to
.Sq Yes
to protect port building with systrace.
Set by the user, e.g. in
.Pa /etc/mmake.cfg .
.It Ev USE_X11
Set to
.Sq Yes
if port requires X11 to work.
.It Ev VMEM_WARNING
Set to
.Sq Yes
if the port requires a lot of memory to compile, and the user is
likely to see a message like
.Qq virtual memory exhausted
with the default process limits.
.It Ev WRKBUILD
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the actual build occurs.
Defaults to ${WRKSRC}.
.It Ev WRKDIR
Location where all port activity occurs.
Apart from the actual port, may
hold all kinds of cookies that checkpoint the port's build.
Read-only.
Ports that need to know the WRKDIR of another port must use
cd that_port_dir && mmake show=WRKDIR for this.
Note that WRKDIR may be a symbolic link.
.It Ev WRKDIST
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} in which the distribution files normally unpacks.
Base for all patches (default: ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME}).
Note that WRKDIST may be a symbolic link, if set to ${WRKDIR}.
.It Ev WRKSRC
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where the actual source is.
Base for configuration (default: ${WRKDIST})
Note that WRKSRC may be a symbolic link, if set to ${WRKDIR}.
.It Ev WRKPKG
Subdirectory of ${WRKBUILD} where package information gets generated.
Defaults to ${WKRBUILD}/pkg, do not override unless
.Sq pkg
conflicts with the port's conventions.
.It Ev WRKINST
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where port normally installs (see
.Ar fake
target).
.It Ev WRKOBJDIR
If non empty, used as a base for the actual port working directory.
The real working directory ${WRKDIR} is created there.
Can be set on a per-${PKGPATH} basis.
For instance, setting WRKOBJDIR_www/mozilla=/tmp/obj
will affect only the mozilla port.
.It Ev X11BASE
Where X11 has been installed (default: /usr/X11R6).
.It Ev XMKMF
Invocation of xmkmf for CONFIGURE_STYLE=imake port.
Defaults to xmkmf \-a \-DPorts.
The \-DPorts is specific to
.Ox
and is always appended.
.It Ev YACC
Name of yacc program to pass to gnu-configure, defaults to yacc.
(gnu-configure would always try to use bison otherwise, which leads to
unreproducible builds.)
Set to bison if needed.

uses a single port with flavours or multi-packages to produce
package variations instead.
.It Ev MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR
Contents were used to replace
.Sq %SUBDIR%

If ${CONFIGURE_SCRIPT} does not exist, no automatic configuration will
be done anyway.
.It Ev NO_DESCRIBE
All ports should generate a description.
.It Ev NO_EXTRACT
Set EXTRACT_ONLY= instead.
.It Ev NO_INSTALL_MANPAGES
Use
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
instead.
.It Ev NO_MTREE
Starting with
.Ox 2.7 ,
the operating system installation script runs the /usr/local specification
globally, instead of embedding it in each package.
So packages no longer record an
.Xr mtree 8
specification.
Use an explicit
.Sq @exec
command if needed.
.It Ev NO_PACKAGE
All ports should generate a package, preferably before install.
.It Ev NO_PATCH
The absence of a patches directory does the same.
Use PATCHDIR and PATCH_LIST if patches need to be changed dynamically.
.It Ev NO_WRKDIR
All ports should have a working directory, as this is necessary to store
cookies and keep state.
.It Ev NO_WRKSUBDIR
The same functionality is obtained by setting WRKDIST=${WRKDIR} .

.Fx
ships with compressed man pages, and uses this variable to control
that behavior.
.It Ev OBJMACHINE
Starting with

setting
.Ev WRKOBJDIR
creates the whole

if package or distribution files can be allowed on ftp sites or cdrom without
legal issues.
Set to reason not to otherwise.
PERMIT_* lines in the Makefile should be preceded with a comment explaining
details about licensing and patents issues the port may have.
Porters must be very thorough in their checks.
In case of doubt, ask.
.It Ev PLIST_SRC
From
.Nx .
This is PLIST.
.Ox
does not give a specific name to the generated file.
It is not recommended to try to access them directly.
.It Ev PKGNAME
Used to refer to the full package name, has been superseded by
.Ev FULLPKGNAME\-foo ,

\-foo .
.Ev PKGNAME
now holds the package name, not taking multi-packages or flavours
into account.
Most ports are not concerned by this change.
.It Ev PLIST_SUBST
From

Use SUBST_VARS instead.
.Ox
does not allow general substitutions of the form VAR=value, but uses
only a list of variables instead.
Most package files gets transformed, instead of only the packing list.
.It Ev RESTRICTED
Port has cryptographic issues.
.Ox
focuses on
.Ev PERMIT_PACKAGE_{FTP,CDROM}
instead.
.It Ev SEPARATE_BUILD
On
.Ox
this could be used to have different WRKBUILD and WRKSRC,
in the hope the port didn't write to its source directory.
While this way to build is recommended by the GCC SC, it
has proven to be the source of much trouble, so it got
removed in the MirPorts Framework.

.El
.Sh THE FAKE FRAMEWORK
The
.Ar fake
target is used to install the port in a private directory first, ready for
packaging by the
.Ar package
target, so that the real installation will use the package.
.Pp
Essentially,
.Ar fake
invokes a real
.Ar install
process after tweaking a few variables.
.Pp
.Ar fake
first creates a skeleton tree under ${WRKINST}, using the
.Xr mtree 8
specification
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/fake.mtree .
.Pp
A
.Ar pre\-fake
target may be used to complete that skeleton tree.
For instance, a few ports may need supplementary stuff to be present (as
it would be installed if the ports' dependencies were present).
.Pp
If {pre,do,post}\-install overrides are present, they are used with some
important changes: PREFIX is set to ${WRKINST}${PREFIX}, ${DESTDIRNAME}
is set to ${WRKINST}, and TRUEPREFIX is set to ${PREFIX}.
Essentially, old install targets work transparently, except for a need to
change PREFIX to TRUEPREFIX for symbolic links and similar path lookups.
Specific traditional post install work can be simply removed, as it will
be taken care of by the package itself (for instance, ldconfig, or
texinfo's install\-info).
.Pp
If no do\-install override is present, the port is installed using
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
env \-i ${MAKE_ENV}
PREFIX=${WRKINST}${PREFIX} ${DESTDIRNAME}=${WRKINST} TRUEPREFIX=${PREFIX}
${MAKE_PROGRAM} ${FAKE_FLAGS} \-f ${MAKE_FILE} ${FAKE_TARGET}
.Ed
.Pp
Note that this does set both PREFIX and ${DESTDIRNAME}.
If a port's Makefile both heeds ${DESTDIRNAME},
and references PREFIX explicitly,
FAKE_FLAGS may rectify the problem by setting PREFIX=${PREFIX}
(which will do the right thing, since ${PREFIX} is a
.Xr make 1
construct which will not be seen by the shell).
.Pp
${FAKE_FLAGS} is used to set variables on
.Xr make 1
command line, which will override the port Makefile contents.
Thus, a port that mentions DESTDIR= does not need any patch to work with fake.
.Sh FLAVOURS AND MULTI_PACKAGES
Starting with
.Ox 2.7 ,
each port can generate several packages through two orthogonal mechanisms:
FLAVOURS and MULTI_PACKAGES.
.Pp
If a port can be compiled with several options, set FLAVOURS to the list of
possible options in the Makefile.
When building the port, set
.Li "FLAVOUR=\*(aqoption1 option2...\*(aq"
to build a specific flavour of the port.
The Makefile should test the value of FLAVOUR as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
FLAVOUR?=
\&.if ${FLAVOUR:L:Moption1}
# what to do if option1
\&.endif
\&.if ${FLAVOUR:L:Moption2}
# what to do if option2
\&.endif
.Ed
.Pp
.Pa bsd.port.mk
takes care of a few details, such as generating a distinct work directory for
each flavour, or adding a dash separated list of options to the package
name.
The order in which FLAVOUR is specified does not matter: the generated list,
called the canonical package extension, matches the ordering of FLAVOURS.
Also, it is an error to specify an option in FLAVOUR that does not appear
in FLAVOURS.
.Pp
In recursive package building, flavours can be specified as a comma
separated list after the package directory, e.g., SUBDIR+=vim,no_x11.
.Pp
Finally, packing information will use templates with the canonical package
extension if they are available: if FLAVOUR=\*(aqoption1 option2\*(aq and both
COMMENT and COMMENT\-option1\-option2 are available, COMMENT\-option1\-option2 will
be used.
.Pp
If a port can generate several useful packages, set MULTI_PACKAGES
accordingly.
Each extension of a MULTI_PACKAGES name should start with a dash, so that
they cannot be confused with FLAVOURS.
In dependency checking and recursive builds, a subpackage can be
specified after a comma, e.g., SUBDIR+=quake,\-server.
MULTI_PACKAGES only affects the actual package building step (and the
describe step, since a MULTI_PACKAGES port will produce several
descriptions).
.Pp
If MULTI_PACKAGES is set, each element of MULTI_PACKAGES triggers a
recursive mmake package, with SUBPACKAGE set to the right value, and
PACKAGING defined.
For instance, if MULTI_PACKAGES=\-lib \-server,
mmake package will work as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Run env SUBPACKAGE= PACKAGING= mmake package,
.It
Run env SUBPACKAGE=\-lib PACKAGING=\-lib mmake package,
.It
Run env SUBPACKAGE=\-server PACKAGING=\-server mmake package,
.El
.Pp
The port's Makefile can test the value of SUBPACKAGE to specialize
processing for all sub packages.
Note that SUBPACKAGE can also be set for dependency checking, so be
careful to also test PACKAGING: the build stage is shared among all
subpackages, and tests often only make sense during the packaging stage.
All packing information is derived from
templates with SUBPACKAGE appended.
In the preceding example, the packing-list template for pkgname-foo
must be in PLIST\-foo.
.Sh THE GENERATION OF PACKING INFORMATION
Starting after
.Ox 2.7
(around revision 1.300 of bsd.port.mk), all packing information is
generated from templates in ${PKGDIR}.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
If not overridden by the user, determine which set of templates to use,
depending on the current SUBPACKAGE and FLAVOUR information.
Set ${PLIST}, ${DESCR}, ${COMMENT}, ${MESSAGE} accordingly.
.It
Detect the existence of ${PKGDIR}/{REQ,INSTALL,DEINSTALL}${SUBPACKAGE}.
Modify PKG_ARGS accordingly, to use the generated files, and add
dependencies to regenerate the files if the templates change.
.It
Generate the actual DESCR, and if needed, MESSAGE, REQ, INSTALL, DEINSTALL
from the templates in ${DESCR}, ${MESSAGE}, ${PKGDIR}/REQ${SUBPACKAGE},
${PKGDIR}/INSTALL${SUBPACKAGE}, ${PKGDIR}/DEINSTALL${SUBPACKAGE}, by
substituting the variables in ${SUBST_VARS}, and by substituting
${FLAVOURS} with the canonical flavour extension for this port,
e.g., if FLAVOURS=no_map gfx qt2, if FLAVOUR=gfx no_map, this is
.Sq \-no_map\-gfx .
.It
Generate the actual PLIST from the template ${PLIST},
by inserting shared/no\-shared fragments, applying a possible user-supplied
pipeline, merging other fragments, applying the same variable
substitutions as other packing information, and finally handling
dynamic libraries macros.
.El
.Pp
Note that ${COMMENT} is currently not substituted, to speed up
.Ar describe
generation.
.Pp
To avoid substitution, variables can be escaped as follows:
.Li "$\e{PREFIX}"
.Pp
Constructs such as the line
.Li "%%SHARED%%"
or
.Li "!%%SHARED%%"
in the packing-list template trigger the inclusion of the
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.shared${SUBPACKAGE}
or
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.no\-shared${SUBPACKAGE} .
.Pp
Similarly, if FLAVOURS lists flav1, then the line
.Li "%%flav1%%"
(resp.
.Li "!%%flav1%%" )
will trigger the inclusion of
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.flav1${SUBPACKAGE}
(resp.
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.no\-flav1${SUBPACKAGE} )
in the packing-list.
Fragments that cannot be handled by these simple rules
can always be specified in a custom SED_PLIST.
.Pp
The constructs
.Li "DYNLIBDIR(directory)"
and
.Li "NEWDYNLIBDIR(directory)"
should be used in
.Pa ${PKGDIR}/PFRAG.shared${SUBPACKAGE}
to register directories that hold dynamic libraries (see
.Xr ldconfig 8 ) .
.Li "NEWDYNLIBDIR"
is meant for directories that will go away when the package is deleted.
If possible, it should not be used, because users also have to edit
.Pa rc.conf
to add the directory.
It is usually better to also let libraries be visible as a link
under ${LOCALBASE}.
Having a separate directory is enough to trick
.Xr ld 1
into grabbing the right version.
Note that libraries used only for
.Xr dlopen 3
do not need NEWDYNLIBDIR.
.Pp
The special
.Ar update\-plist
target does a fairly good job of automatically generating PLIST and
PFRAG.shared fragments.
.Pp
In MULTI_PACKAGES mode, there must be separate COMMENT, DESCR, and PLIST
templates for each SUBPACKAGE (and optional distinct MESSAGE, REQ, INSTALL,
DEINSTALL files in a similar way).
This contrasts with the FLAVOURS
situation, where all these files will automatically default to the
non-flavour version if there is no flavour-specific file around.

improvements.
MirLibtool and the
.Ar autogen
configure style are MirPorts additions.
