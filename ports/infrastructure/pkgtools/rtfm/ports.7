.Sh NAME
.Nm ports
.Nd contributed applications
.Sh DESCRIPTION
MirPorts, the
.Mx
Ports Collection
(shamelessly stolen from the
.Ox
Ports Collection, which in turn was inspired by
.Fx )
offers a simple way
for users and administrators to install applications.
Each port contains any patches necessary to make the original
application source code compile and run on
.Mx , Ox ,
Darwin (Mac OS X) and Interix.
Compiling an application is as simple as typing
.Ic mmake
in the port directory!
The
.Pa Makefile
automatically fetches the
application source code, either from a local disk or via ftp, unpacks it
on the local system, applies the patches, and compiles it.
If all goes well, simply type
.Ic mmake install
to install the application.
.Pp
For more information about using ports, see
.Pa http://mirbsd.de/ports ,
The
.Ox
Ports Mechanism
.Pq Pa http://www.openbsd.org/ports.html
and the
.Ox
FAQ
.Pq Pa http://www.openbsd.org/faq/ .
For information about creating new ports, see also
the
.Ox
Porting Checklist
.Pq Pa http://www.openbsd.org/checklist.html .
.Pp
For a detailed description of the build process and all the variables
in a port Makefile, see
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
For a detailed description of the packing list
.Pq Pa PLIST
format, see
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
.Sh PORTS MASTER MAKEFILE
The ports master Makefile, normally located in
.Pa /usr/ports/Makefile
(but see
.Ev PORTSDIR
below)
offers a few useful targets.
.Bl -tag -width configure
.It Ar index
rebuild the ports complete index,
.Pa /usr/ports/INDEX
.It Ar mirror\-maker
see
.Xr mirroring\-ports 7 ,
.It Ar print\-index
display the contents of the index in a user-friendly way,
.It Ar search
invoked with a key, e.g.,
.Ic mmake search key=foo ,
retrieve information relevant to a given port (obsolescent).
.El
.Sh SELECTING A SET OF PORTS
If
.Pa /usr/ports/INDEX
is up to date, it is possible to select subsets by setting the following
variables on the command line:
.Bl -tag -width category
.It Va key
package name matching the given key,
.It Va category
port belonging to category,
.It Va maintainer
port maintained by a given person.
.El
.Pp
For instance, to invoke clean on all ports in the x11 category, one can say:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
	$ mmake category=x11 clean
.Ed
.Pp
The index search is done by a perl script, so all regular expressions from
.Xr perlre 1
apply.
.Sh TARGETS
Individual ports are controlled through a few documented targets.
Some of these targets work recursively through subdirectories, so that
someone can, for examples, install all of the net
ports.
.Pp
The variable
.Ev SKIPDIR
can hold a set of package directories to avoid during recursion.
These are always specified relative to the root of the ports tree,
and can contain a flavour or subpackage part
.Po
see
.Xr packages\-specs 7
.Pc .
.Pp
In case of failure in a subdirectory, the shell fragment held in
.Ev REPORT_PROBLEM
is executed.
Default behavior is to call exit, but this can be overridden on the command
line, e.g., to avoid stopping after each problem.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ mmake REPORT_PROBLEM=true
.Ed
.Pp
The targets that do this are
.Ar all , build , checksum , clean ,
.Ar configure , extract , fake ,
.Ar fetch , install , distclean ,
.Ar deinstall , reinstall , package ,
.Ar link\-categories , unlink\-categories ,
.Ar describe , show , regress ,
.Ar lib\-depends\-check , homepage\-links , manpages\-check ,
.Ar license\-check , all\-dir\-depends , build\-dir\-depends ,
.Ar run\-dir\-depends
and
.Ar readmes .
.Pp
Target names starting with _ are private to the ports infrastructure,
should not be invoked directly, and are liable to change without notice.
.Pp
In the following list, each target will run the preceding targets
in order automatically.
That is,
.Ar build
will be run
.Pq if necessary
by
.Ar install ,
and so on all the way to
.Ar fetch .
Typical use only runs
.Ar install
explicitly (if root or
.Ev SUDO
is defined in
.Pa /etc/mmake.cfg ) ,
or
.Ar build
(as user), then
.Ar install
(as root).
.Bl -tag -width configure
.It Ar fetch
Fetch all of the files needed to build this port from the site(s)
listed in
.Ev MASTER_SITES
and
.Ev PATCH_SITES .
See
.Ev FETCH_CMD
and
.Ev MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE .
.It Ar checksum
Verify that the fetched distfile matches the one the port was tested against.
Defining
.Ev NO_CHECKSUM
to
.Dv Yes
will skip this step.
Sometimes, distfiles change without warning.
The main
.Ox
mirror should still hold a copy of old distfiles, indexed by checksum.
Using
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ mmake checksum REFETCH=true
.Ed
.Pp
will try to get a set of distfiles that match the recorded checksum.
.It Ar depends
Install
.Pq or package if only compilation is necessary
any dependencies of the current port.
When called by the
.Ar extract , install
or
.Ar fetch
targets, this is run in scattered pieces as
.Ar lib\-depends , build\-depends
and
.Ar run\-depends .
Defining
.Ev NO_DEPENDS
to
.Dv Yes
will skip this step.
.It Ar extract
Expand the distfile into a work directory.
.It Ar patch
Apply any patches that are necessary for the port.
.It Ar configure
Configure the port.
Some ports will ask questions during this stage.
See
.Ev INTERACTIVE
and
.Ev BATCH .
.It Ar build
Build the port.
This is the same as calling the
.Ar all
target.
.It Ar fake
Pretend to install the port under a subdirectory of the work directory.
.It Ar package
Create a binary package from the fake installation.
The package is a .tgz file that can be used to
install the port on several machines with
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.It Ar install
Install the resulting package.
.El
.Pp
The following targets are not run during the normal install process.
.Bl -tag -width fetch-list
.It Ar print\-build\-depends print\-run\-depends
Print an ordered list of all the compile and run dependencies.
.It Ar clean
Remove the expanded source code.
This does not recurse to dependencies unless
.Ev CLEANDEPENDS
is defined to
.Dv Yes .
.It Ar distclean
Remove the port's distfile(s) and perform the
.Ar clean
operation.
This does not recurse to dependencies.
.It Ar reinstall
Use this to restore a port after using
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
.It Ar link\-categories
Populate the ports tree with symbolic links for each category the port
belongs to.
.It Ar unlink\-categories
Remove the symbolic links created by
.Ar link\-categories .
.El
.Sh BULK PACKAGE BUILDING
The ports tree contains some mechanisms to save space when building
large collections of packages.
If
.Ev BIN_PACKAGES ,
.Ev TRUST_PACKAGES ,
and
.Ev BULK
are set to
.Sq Yes
for a package build, some shortcuts are taken to allow cleaning up working
directories on the fly.
.Pp
Some important caveats apply:
the packages already built in the package repository are assumed to be
up-to-date (BIN_PACKAGES), the database of installed packages is assumed
to be accurate (TRUST_PACKAGES), and the bulk cookies are assumed to be
up-to-date (BULK).
.Pp
This means that newer iterations of package buildings should make sure
those conditions are met, which entails erasing old package repository,
removing packages that need to be rebuilt from the base of installed
packages, and cleaning up old bulk cookies.
.Pp
If any of these conditions is not met, the package build may run into weird
problems.
.Sh NETWORK CONFIGURATION
The variables pertaining to network access have been marshalled into
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/template/network.conf.template .
.Pp
To customize that setup, copy that file into
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/network.conf
and edit it.
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev MASTER_SITE_OPENBSD
If set to
.Dv Yes ,
include the master
.Ox
site when fetching files.
.It Ev MASTER_SITE_FREEBSD
If set to
.Dv Yes ,
include the master
.Fx
site when fetching files.
.It Ev MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE
Go to this site first for all files.
.El
.Sh FLAVOURS
MirPorts comes with a mechanism called
.Ic FLAVOURS .
Thanks to this mechanism, users can select specific options provided by
a given port.
.Pp
If a port is "flavoured", there should be a terse description of
available flavours in the
.Pa pkg/DESCR
file.
.Pp
For example, the shells/tcsh port comes with a flavour called
.Ic static .
This changes the building process so a statically compiled version of
the program will be built.
To avoid confusion with other packages or flavours,
the package name will be extended with a dash-separated list of
the selected flavours.
.Pp
In this instance, the corresponding package will be called
.Ic tcsh\-6.13.00\-0\-static .
.Pp
To build a port with a specific flavour, just pass
.Ev FLAVOUR
in the environment of the
.Xr make 1
command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ env FLAVOUR="static" mmake package
.Ed
.Pp
and of course, use the same settings for the subsequent invocations of make:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ env FLAVOUR="static" mmake package
$ env FLAVOUR="static" mmake clean
.Ed
.Pp
More than one flavour may be specified:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ cd /usr/ports/mail/exim
$ env FLAVOUR="mysql ldap" mmake package
.Ed
.Pp
Specifying a flavour that does not exist is an error.
Additionally, some ports impose some further restrictions on flavour
combinations, when such combinations do not make sense.
.Pp
Lots of ports can be built without X11 requirement and accordingly
have a
.Ic no_x11
flavour.
.Pp
Flavour settings are not propagated to dependencies.
If a specific combination is needed, careful hand-building of the
required set of packages is still necessary.
.Sh MULTI_PACKAGES
MirPorts comes with a mechanism called
.Ic MULTI_PACKAGES.
This mechanism is used when a larger package is broken down into
several smaller components referred to as subpackages.
.Pp
If a port is "subpackaged", in addition to the main package, each
subpackage will have a corresponding description in the
.Pa pkg/DESCR\-subpackage
file.
.Pp
For example, the database/mysql port comes with subpackages called
.Ic tests
and
.Ic server .
.Pp
In this instance, the build will yield multiple packages, one
corresponding to each subpackage. In the case of our mysql example,
the subpackages will be called
.Ic mysql\-tests\-<version> and mysql\-server\-<version> .
.Pp
When
.Ic mmake install
is invoked, all subpackages are installed by default.
See
.Ev PREFER_SUBPKG_INSTALL
below for how to change this.
To install/deinstall a specific subpackage of a port, you may
.Xr pkg_add 1
them manually, or alternatively, you may set
.Ev SUBPACKAGE
in the environment of the
.Xr make 1
command during the install/deinstall phase:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ env SUBPACKAGE="\-server" mmake install
$ env SUBPACKAGE="\-server" mmake deinstall
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh PORT VARIABLES
These can be changed in the environment, or in
.Pa /etc/mmake.cfg
for persistence.
They can also be set on make's command line, e.g.,
.Ic mmake VAR_FOO=foo
.Pp
Boolean variables should be set to
.Dv Yes
instead of simply being defined, for uniformity and future compatibility.
.Pp
Variable names starting with _ are private to the ports infrastructure,
should not be changed by the user, and are liable to change without notice.
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev BATCH
If defined, only operate on a port if it can be installed 100% automatically.
.It Ev BULK_COOKIES_DIR
During bulk package building, used to store cookies for already built
packages to avoid rebuilding them, since the actual
working directory will already have been cleaned out.
Defaults to bulk/${MACHINE_ARCH} under
.Ev PORTSDIR .
.It Ev CLEANDEPENDS
If set to
.Dv Yes ,
let
.Sq clean
recurse to dependencies.
.It Ev DISTDIR
Where to find/put distfiles, normally
.Pa Distfiles/
in
.Ev PORTSDIR .
.It Ev FETCH_CMD
Command to use to fetch files.

.Ar package
target; the base directory for the packages tree, normally
.Pa Packages/
in
.Ev PORTSDIR .
If this directory exists, the package tree will be (partially) constructed.
This directory does not have to exist; if it doesn't, packages will be
placed into the current directory, or define one of
.Bl -tag -width PKGREPOSITORY
.It Ev PKGREPOSITORY
Directory to put the package in.
.It Ev PKGFILE
The full path to the package.
.El
.It Ev PORTSDIR
Location of the ports tree

Default is Yes.
.It Ev USE_SYSTRACE
Set to
.Sq Yes
to protect the
.Ar configure , build ,
and
.Ar fake
targets with
.Xr systrace 1 .
This way it is ensured that ports do not make any network connections
during build or write outside some well defined directories.
The filter list is stored in
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/db/systrace.filter .
.It Ev VMEM_AUTOUNLOCK
