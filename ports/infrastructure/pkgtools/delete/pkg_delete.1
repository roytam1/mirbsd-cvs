.Dt PKG_DELETE 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_delete
.Nd delete previously installed software package distributions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_delete
.Op Fl DUcdfnqv
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Ar pkg-name Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to delete packages that have been previously installed
with the
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.
.Pp
Package names may be specified either as the package name with or without
version, as the path of the installation log directory, or as a filename
with suffix.
If a name without version is given and there are multiple versions of the
package installed
.Pq for example, with the autoconf packages ,
.Nm
will fail.
.Pp
For example, the following will work:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% pkg_delete libpixman-0.1.6-0
% pkg_delete libpixman
% pkg_delete /usr/mpkg/db/pkg/libpixman-0.1.6-0/
% pkg_delete libpixman-0.1.6-0.cgz
.Ed
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar pkg-name Op Ar ...
The named packages are deinstalled.
.It Fl D
If a deinstallation script exists for a given package, do not execute it.
.It Fl U
Unregister the package but don't actually delete any files.
Useful for upgrades of base packages, for example the pkgtools themselves.
Use with caution.
.It Fl c
Delete configuration files and directories, mentioned as
.Cm @extra
or
.Cm @sample
in the packing-list.
.It Fl C
Only delete configuration files that have the same checksum as the
original file, i.e. those that have not been changed by the user.
.It Fl d
Remove empty directories created by file cleanup.
By default, only
files/directories explicitly listed in a package's contents (either as
normal files/directories or with the
.Cm @dirrm
directive and a shared reference counter of 1) will be removed
at deinstallation time.
This option tells
.Nm
to also remove any directories that were emptied as a result of removing
the package.
.It Fl f
Force removal of the package, even if a dependency is recorded or the
deinstall or require script fails.
Also force removing base packages.
Use with care.
.It Fl n
Don't actually deinstall a package, just report the steps that
would be taken if it were.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Set
.Ar prefix
as the directory in which to delete files from any installed packages
which do not explicitly set theirs.
For most packages, the prefix will
be set automatically to the installed location by
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.It Fl q
Delete package quickly, do not bother checking md5 sums before removing files.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.El
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
.Nm
does pretty much what it says.
It examines installed package records in
.Ev $LOCALBASE Ns Pa /db/pkg/<pkg-name> ,
deletes the package contents, and finally removes the package records.
.Pp
If a package is required by other installed packages,
.Nm
will list those dependent packages and refuse to delete the package
(unless the
.Fl f
option is given).
.Pp
If the package contains a
.Ar require
file (see
.Xr pkg_create 1 ) ,
then this is executed first as
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Cm require
.Ar <pkg-name>
.Ar DEINSTALL
.Ed
.Pp
(where
.Ar pkg-name
is the name of the package in question and
.Ar DEINSTALL
is a keyword denoting that this is a deinstallation)
to see whether or not deinstallation should continue.
A non-zero exit status means no, unless the
.Fl f
option is specified.
.Pp
If a
.Cm deinstall
script exists for the package, it is executed before any files are removed.
It is this script's responsibility to clean up any additional messy details
around the package's installation, since all
.Nm
knows how to do is delete the files created in the original distribution.
The
.Nm deinstall
script is called as:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Cm deinstall
.Ar <pkg-name>
.Ar DEINSTALL
.Ed
.Pp
Passing the keyword
.Ar DEINSTALL
lets you potentially write only one program/script that handles all
aspects of installation and deletion.
.Pp
All scripts are called with the environment variable
.Ev PKG_PREFIX
set to the installation prefix (see the
.Fl p
option above).
This allows a package author to write a script
that reliably performs some action on the directory where the package
is installed, even if the user might have changed it by specifying the
.Fl p
option when running
.Nm
or
.Cm pkg_add .

.Sh WARNING
.Bf -emphasis
Since the
.Nm
command may execute scripts or programs provided by a package file,
your system may be susceptible to
.Dq trojan horses
or other subtle
attacks from miscreants who create dangerous package files.
.Pp
You are advised to verify the competence and identity of those who
provide installable package files.
For extra protection, examine all
the package control files in the package record directory
.Pq Pa /var/db/pkg/<pkg-name>/ .
Pay particular
attention to any +INSTALL, +DEINSTALL, +REQUIRE or +MTREE_DIRS files,
and inspect the +CONTENTS file for
.Cm @cwd ,
.Cm @mode
(check for setuid),
.Cm @dirrm ,
.Cm @exec ,
and
.Cm @unexec
directives, and/or use the
.Xr pkg_info 1
command to examine the installed package control files.
