The MirPorts Framework
----------------------

This is the MirPorts Framework plus ports, a subproject
of The MirOS Project - http://mirbsd.de/

The MirPorts Framework is a defined way to install third-party
application software on OpenBSD and its derivates. It is main-
tained independently within the MirOS CVS Repository, but pri-
marily developed on MirOS BSD.

MirPorts currently works on:
 * OpenBSD 3.4 (not tested)
 * OpenBSD 3.5
 * OpenBSD 3.6 (and up)
 * MirOS BSD #8
 * Mac OSX 10.3
 * Mac OSX 10.4
XXX this is out of date

For installation, configure your /etc/mk.conf to contain
| SUDO?=sudo
in order to be able to work as regular user, then change
to the MirPorts directory (usually /usr/ports) and issue
$ make setup

Go to http://wiki.mirbsd.de/MirPorts for details.

The MirPorts Framework itself is copyrighted and licenced under
the same terms as MirOS base is. Patches which come with ports
are covered by the same terms and conditions the patched file is;
if it is not possible for us to distribute an unified diff patch
we will distribute a forward ed(1) patch which is not tained by
these terms and conditions, thus cannot be hindered to be redi-
stributed freely.

The MirOS base licence is available at /usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE
on an installed MirOS system, or at src/share/doc/legal/LICENCE via
anonymous CVS or CVSweb for public display.
