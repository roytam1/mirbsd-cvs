The MirPorts Framework
----------------------

This is the MirPorts Framework plus ports, a subproject
of The MirOS Project - http://mirbsd.de/

The MirPorts Framework is a defined way to install third-party
application software on OpenBSD and its derivates. It is main-
tained independently within the MirOS CVS Repository, but pri-
marily developed on MirOS BSD.

MirPorts currently works on:
 * OpenBSD 3.4 (not tested)
 * OpenBSD 3.5
 * OpenBSD 3.6 (and up)
 * Ã†rieBSD (not tested)
 * MidnightBSD 0.2-CURRENT (and up)
 * MirOS BSD #8 (and up)
 * Mac OSX 10.3
 * Mac OSX 10.4
 * Mac OSX 10.5
 * Mac OSX 10.6
 * Interix/SFU 3.5
 * Interix/SUA 6.x
XXX this is out of date

For installation, change to the MirPorts directory
(usually /usr/ports) and issue the following command:
$ make setup

You do NOT need to do that if you selected the pkgutl10.ngz
distribution set during the MirBSD installer run!

Read the Setup.sh(8) manual page for further information,
or go to http://www.mirbsd.org/ports.htm for details.

The MirPorts Framework itself is copyrighted and licenced under
the same terms as MirOS base is. Patches which come with ports
are covered by the same terms and conditions the patched file is;
if it is not possible for us to distribute an unified diff patch
we will distribute a forward ed(1) patch which is not tained by
these terms and conditions, thus cannot be hindered to be redi-
stributed freely.

The MirOS base licence is available at /usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE
on an installed MirOS system, or at src/share/doc/legal/LICENCE via
anonymous CVS or CVSweb for public display. See also: ./Makefile
