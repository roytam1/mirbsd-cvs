This package contains the GNU version of the traditional UN*X text
formatting tools troff, nroff, tbl, eqn, and pic. These utilities
are essential for generating or displaying the on-line manual pages.

This basic package contains the necessary components to format text
in ASCII, Latin-1, and UTF-8 (groff's default). If you require the
full GNU groff toolchain, install the no-console flavour instead.

Besides these, the groff package contains man pages describing the language
and its macro sets, info documentation, and a number of supplementary
programmes:
 - groffer, a newbie interface
 - grog, which can determine the correct macro package automatically
 - gdiffmk, which is used to diff two *roff input files
 - grn, a preprocessor for pictures in the 'gremlin' format
 - refer, which preprocesses bibliographic references for use with groff
 - indxbib, which creates inverted indices for bibliographic databases used
   by 'refer'
 - lkbib and lookbib, which search bibliographic databases
 - mmroff, a simple groff preprocessor which expands references in mm

All the standard macro packages are supported. Some of the system's
macro packages are wrapped; use -mgdoc to access the GNU version of
the mdoc macros, -mdoc for the BSD version; -man for an automatic
detection between GNU man and BSD mdoc macros, -mandoc for an auto-
matic detection between BSD man and BSD mdoc macros, -mgan for an
automatic detection between GNU man and GNU mdoc macros; finally,
-man-old for GNU man and -man.old for BSD man macros.
