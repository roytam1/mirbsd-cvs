| This package also contains a sample man.conf(5) file which
| has been generated at build time from the system /etc/man.conf
| replacing all occurences of nroff by gnroff, thus enabling
| MirOS man(1) to make use of GNU groff. You might want to add
| | alias gman='man -C ${PREFIX}/share/groff/man.conf'
| to your ~/.profile file.
