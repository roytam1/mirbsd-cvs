GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. It can be
used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures. It includes an
advanced key management facility and is compliant with the proposed
OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880 (RFC 2440, RFC 1991).

GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to the
version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes with no
support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop environments,
but also with less dependencies.
