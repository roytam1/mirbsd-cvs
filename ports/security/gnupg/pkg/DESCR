GnuPG is the GNU project's complete and free implementation of the
OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC2440. GnuPG allows to encrypt and
sign your data and communication, features a versatile key managment
system as well as access modules for all kind of public key
directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with
features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of
frontend applications and libraries are available.

It has more security bugs than PGP 2.6.* and is only compatible with
the latter (e.g. in security/pgp+) if you don't use the no_idea
flavour.
