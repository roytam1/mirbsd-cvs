      Pretty Good Privacy version 2.6.3in (world wide use extended)

PGP 2.6.3in is not an official PGP version. It is based on the source
code for MIT PGP 2.6.2 and has been modified for world wide use. PGP
2.6.3i (international) is legal in the United States after September 6,
2000 (when RSA Security, Inc. placed its public key encryption algo-
rithm in the public domain). The only fact preventing this version from
being used commercially is the patent on IDEA by Ascom Tech, Switzerland.

For more detailed information about licencing, please refer to the file
README.MirPorts, and for a more thorough installation and usage guide,
refer to the file setup.doc and the documentation for PGP 2.6.2, which is
included unmodified in the doc/ subdirectory that is created when you
unpack the distribution archive and installed in /usr/local/share/doc.
