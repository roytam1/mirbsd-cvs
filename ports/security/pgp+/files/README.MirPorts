This is a programme derived from Philip Zimmermann's PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) Version 2.6.2; called pgp-2.6.3in (international use).

PGP is a programme which generates and manages assymetric RSA keys,
peruses MD5 to sign and IDEA to encrypt messages.
The RSA and MD5 algorithms are publically usable and patent-free as
of the time of writing this; however, the IDEA symmetric cipher is
not. There are patents in the USA, Japan and large parts of Europe
covering the IDEA symmetric cipher, and the RFC1991 v3 PGP doesn't
support using blowfish instead.

The MirPorts Framework offers several distinct versions of PGP for
this reason; the ports/security/pgp+ directory contains pgp-2.6.3in
by Lutz Donnerhacke.

The MirPorts version, compiled with -DUNIX, also reads 1 KiB worth
of data from /dev/arandom (or /dev/urandom, if the former does not
exist) and feeds that to the internal PGP random pool upon startup
in order to increase the potential entropy.
If you feel like it, you can feed the $PGPPATH/randseed.bin into
your OS' random generator after executing pgp, but usually, the OS
intercepts keystrokes better than PGP itself, so there is no need.


The licencing conditions for pgp-2.6.3in are to be found below;
a summary can be found at the end of this file.

(The following paragraph is a summary from the remaining legal blurbs
 out of the PGP documentation by PRZ:)
PGP is freeware. Give it to your friends. (...) I place no restraints
on your modifying the source code for your own use. However, do not
distribute a modified version of PGP under the name "PGP" without first
getting permission from me. (...) I still do not want the GPL to apply
to PGP, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is because the
GPL is not optimal for protecting PGP from being republished with
ad-hoc "improvements". (...) Under no circumstances may PGP be distributed
without the PGP documentation, including this PGP User's Guide.


Commentary about the IDEA patent:

The IDEA cipher is patented in:
 - Japan (pending)
 - USA (until 25 May 2010)
 - Europe (until 16 May 2011)
   including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the
   Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom

Ascom Tech has granted an unlimited licence for non-commercial,
personal use of the IDEA cipher with PGP and other freeware, see

Conclusion:
 * This programme is not PGP, it is derived from PGP.
 * This programme is freeware, coming from outside the USA,
   therefore, the export control restrictions do not apply.
 * This software is subject to the usual freeware conditions
   and disclaimers; free to use in any environment.
 * This version comes with IDEA, which means you have to
   obtain a licence from Ascom Tech unless you are a non-
   commercial, personal user, in which case you apply for
   the freeware licence.
   If you are a commercial user, or gouvernment user in
   the USA, you must, however, obtain the commercial PGP
   version from ViaCrypt, Phoenix, Arizona <viacrypt@acm.org>
   in order to be eligible as a PGP user.
 * The MIT asks for changes to be published to MIT with a
   licence to integrate it into their distribution.
 * THIS MEANS: if you are merely using this MirPorts package,
   you don't have to worry; if you want to redistribute it,
   please check the PERMIT_* variables; please don't omit the
   documentation, and if you are modifying anything, please
   publish it; there's nothing else except for that and the
   IDEA patent, described above.
