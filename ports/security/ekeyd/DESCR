Simtec Electronics UDEKEY01 Entropy Key Daemon

This is a collection of utilities to drive the Simtec Entropy Key.
The ekey-ulusbd may not work, as it requires to specify bus and
device ID, which I could not find out. The regular ekeyd requires
at least MirBSD #10-current (2009-11-05).


The following snippet can be added to /etc/daily.local for monitoring:

print
print "Daily eKey stats"
(${PREFIX}/sbin/ekeydctl list | column -ts,) 2>&1
${PREFIX}/sbin/ekeydctl list 2>/dev/null | while IFS=, read nr rest; do
	[[ $nr = +([0-9]) ]] || continue
	print
	print "Daily stats for eKey #$nr"
	${PREFIX}/sbin/ekeydctl stats $nr
done 2>&1
