This is tcpdump, a network analysis tool which used to be part of
the MirBSD base system until its retrieval, use, and distribution
became illegal in Germany because it can be misused as “hacker” –
reads: cracker – tool, just like a sharp bread knife might be ab-
used as a murder tool. Thank you, politicians, we trust in you!
