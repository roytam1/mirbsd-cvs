The BSD::arc4random module contains
• ithreads-safe Perl bindings for
  ‣ arc4random()
  ‣ arc4random_addrandom()
  ‣ arc4random_pushb()
  ‣ arc4random_pushk()
  ‣ arc4random_stir()
• Pure Perl implementation of
  ‣ arc4random_bytes()
  ‣ arc4random_uniform()
• the ability to tie scalars to it
• a tied global $RANDOM variable behaving exactly like in mksh
• a have_kintf() constant function returning if arc4random_pushb()
  and arc4random_pushk() are aliases to arc4random_addrandom() or
  do indeed work with the kernel (and if only one of them exists,
  the other one is aliased to it)
• mksh’s contributed arc4random.c file for GNU operating systems
  with a couple of improvements (temporary, until mirngd is done)
