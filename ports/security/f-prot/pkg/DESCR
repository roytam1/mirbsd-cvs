For home users using the BSD open-source operating system,
we offer F-Prot Antivirus for BSD Workstations. F-Prot
Antivirus for BSD Workstations utilizes the renowned F-Prot
Antivirus scanning engine for primary scan but has in
addition to that a system of internal heuristics devised to
search for unknown viruses

F-Prot Antivirus for BSD was especially developed to
effectively eradicate viruses threatening workstations
running FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD. It provides full
protection against macro viruses and other forms of
malicious software - including Trojans.

F-Prot for BSD Workstations features:
 * Scans for over 132796 known viruses and their variants
 * Ability to perform scheduled scans when used with the
   Unix cron utility
 * Scans hard drives, CD-ROMS, diskettes, network drives,
   directories and specific files
 * Scans for images of boot sector viruses, macro viruses
   and Trojan Horses

This is "free for personal use" but neither shareware nor
freeware. Please read the enclosed LICENSE files before
