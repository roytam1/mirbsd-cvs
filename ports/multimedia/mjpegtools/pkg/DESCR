The mjpegtools are a set of programs that can do recording, playback,
editing and eventual MPEG compression of audio and video under Linux.

Although primarily intended for use with capture / playback boards
based on the Zoran ZR36067 MJPEG codec chip, the mjpegtools can easily
be used to process and compress MJPEG video streams captured using
xawtv using simple frame-buffer devices.

There are two FLAVOURs for this port:

  optimized - This FLAVOUR turns on processor specific compiler
    optimizations.  Without this FLAVOUR, these optimizations are
    turned off.

  quicktime - This FLAVOUR allows the mjpegtools to read and write
    Quicktime files.
