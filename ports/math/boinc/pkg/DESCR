BOINC is a software platform for distributed computing using
volunteer computer resources.

Many different projects can use BOINC. SETI@HOME, for example,
has been redesigned to use BOINC, as well as the World Community
Grid project.

This package contains the command line client and the command
line control tool (CLI).
