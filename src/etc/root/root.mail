Subject: Welcome to MirOS #8 - the innovative BSD experience!

Welcome on your newly installed MirOS system.

This is the formal release of MirOS #8 BSD, GCC and X11,
with a snapshot of the current MirPorts Framework added.

If you're no Unix® guru, you probably will not be reading
this or installing MirOS anyway, but what the hack, if you
didn't know them already:

The on-line documentation system "man" can be run by simply
typing the word "man" on the command line followed by the
command or topic on which you want help. For example, man's
documentation can be retrieved by typing
$ man man
and for a very basic help, you can simply type
$ help
as a special short alias.

Do not type in the '$' sign, it's the prompt shown by your
shell. A '$' means the user shell, while a '#' means the
root shell (although you should be using sudo(1) anyway).

If you read 'sudo(1)' you know that the command 'sudo' is
in man section 1 - this is important because sometimes a
command and a library function have the same name. To read
help for sudo(1) type
$ man 1 sudo

You should read afterboot(8) for more basic instructions,
and use lynx(1) to connect to the MirOS Project's web site
regarding set-up instructions:
	http://mirbsd.de/welcome

For some programmes, info(1) is the preferred documentation
format - these are utilities from the GNU project, which are
also covered by different, slightly less free, licence terms.
Please take your time to read the file
	/usr/share/doc/legal/1stREAD
and the linked files, for example using less(1) as pager.

If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to
contact the MirOS project, for example by using our public
discussion mailing list (instructions on the website), also
available via the GMane mailinglist-to-{news,web,RSS} service
under "gmane.os.miros.general", or by Internet Relay Chat on
the Freeforge network, Channel #mirbsd (for example on the
server irc.66h.42h.de:6667 or 6666, or 6668 with SSL).

To install the MirPorts Framework, please follow the setup
instructions on http://mirbsd.de/ports, but
we try to stay backwards-compatible enough to enable you to:
$ cd /usr/ports
$ make setup
$ cd /usr/ports/editors/joe
$ mmake install clean
after having installed the 'ports8.ngz' distribution set and
upgrading ports via CVS, or checking them out freshly. You
can (and probably should) be using ports-current for quite a
while after the release. Please remember that you always have
to use 'mmake' instead of 'make' to build a port. Packages
are installed into /usr/mpkg, thus you can for example do this:
$ echo export EDITOR=/usr/mpkg/bin/jupp >>~/.profile
after executing the four commands above, to use the editor.

We would like to wish you to have good luck and a lot of
fun with your newly installed MirOS system!
