Note: of course, this is "MirOS XP" (MirOS #8 experimental).
The text below is out of date and should be fixed.

This is MirOS BSD Release #7bis
-------------------------------

MirOS is an advanced operating system project with its code based
upon and regularily synched against the OpenBSD operating system,
which you can learn more about at http://www.openbsd.org/

MirOS BSD is not intended for beginners. Support is only given in
the channel #deutsch of the former OpenProjectsIRC network at the
moment - irc.eu.freenode.net is your friend, and it's the default
network the client /usr/bin/tinyirc connects to.

For information about how to set up an OpenBSD system, refer to
the "afterboot" manual page. If you are not familiar with the
UNIX manual systems, type "man man" at the prompt after exiting
the mail subsystem. The texinfo manual system is installed as
well, type "info info" if you want to inform yourself about that.
Type "man -k keyword" to search for 'keyword' within the manual
page descriptions.
Please pay special attention to the Frequently Asked Questions
section at	http://www.OpenBSD.org/faq/

Significant efforts were made to centralize all system configu-
ration in the /etc directory and the newly designed ~/.etc hier-
archy within your home directory. You should be able to find each
of the configuration files you seek there, lightly documented.
In particular, much of the configuration has been centralized
in the file /etc/rc.conf. You should not need to ever edit the
file /etc/rc. The files /etc/rc.securelevel and /etc/rc.local
exist for this purpose; the first is run before the system has
gone into secure mode; the second is run afterwards (if in
doubt, add your tools to rc.local). You should not need to edit
/etc/rc.conf either, just write any changes into /etc/rc.conf.local
which you will have to create at the first time.
It is highly recommended to use RCS to version control your
configuration files in /etc. Just use 'ci -l filename' to check
in the changes each time; you will see that the files are locked
for editing by root.
If you prefer strict locking, use this set of commands:
'ci filename; co -u filename' to RCS the file, and 'co -l filename;
$EDITOR filename; ci -u filename' to edit it.

If you would like to contact the creators of MirOS, see the web
site at https://MirBSD.BSDadvocacy.org:8890/ (the popular lynx
web browser is part of the base system) or refer to the file
/usr/share/misc/contrib/mirabile.asc for email, PGP and SSH keys.
MirOS is free to use for anyone, and subject to extremely few
restrictions, please refer to http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html,
/usr/share/man/COPYRIGHT, /usr/share/doc and the MirOS web site).
Free software cannot be created without money either, so please
do consider to donate a certain amount of money to the MirOS
project. We are sponsoring the OpenBSD project as well.

For commercial quality support of MirOS please refer to
 http://www.sourcemill.com/  (service is being built up now).

Attention: the configuration of the popular lynx web browser differs
slightly from the pristine configuration - in particular, persistent
cookies are enabled by default, and textfields need activation.

MirOS uses the "softupdates" (softdep) technique to drastically
improve the speed of ffs filesystems, while not loosing the safety
of synchronous mounts which are used by default. This can only work
safely if you disable the hardware write cache of your hard discs.
Since MirOS BSD #7bis, this is done automatically if your wd* HDD
slices are listed in /etc/fstab with "softdep" and not renamed away
from "wd*".

This enables you to safely skip fsck on every boot and only use
it manually, say once a month. To do that, alter the last column
in /etc/fstab of the filesystem to be zero. WARNING: Do not do this
for the root filesystem or on a non-softdep or non-ffs filesystem.

You probably want to obtain the MirPorts framework for your version
of the MirOS BSD operating system. You can use anoncvs to check out
the tree from CVSROOT=mirbsd-cvs@mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org:/cvs using
the password 'anoncvs' and the module 'ports'.

The anoncvs facility is built into the MirBSD system: just configure
the directory structure below /var/anoncvs to suit your needs, enable
the user "_anoncvs" by removing the asterisk ("*") in its password
field, move the source tree into /var/anoncvs/anoncvs/cvs (you may
want to create a symlink to that from /cvs), eventually change the
settings in /usr/src/distrib/anoncvs/Makefile, execute "make obj",
"make depend", "make" and "sudo make install", voilá, you're set up.

A fair amount of SSL X509v3 Root CA Certificates has been installed
into /etc/ssl/certs/ so that both Lynx and the
Sendmail MTA are capable of verifying presented certificates on SSL
lines by default. You might want to re-validate these according to
your site-local policy.
Additionally, sendmail has been configured to be TLS enabled as-is,
which means a snake-oil certificate is installed and used at the
moment. Simply remove the "-C /etc/mail/localhost.cf" from the line
in /etc/rc.conf, put it into /etc/rc.conf.local and re-start; it will
start using TLS at once. If you have received a different certificate
you would like to install, read the starttls(8) manual page and the
/etc/mail/sendmail.cf configuration file.
