.Sh NAME
.Nm fdialog
.Nd scriptable menu generation system for curses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Ar widget widget_specific_arg1 ... [height width]
.Op Fl sleep Ar seconds
.Op Fl ptitle Ar title
.Op Fl text Ar text
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility processes a set of widget specifications passed as command
line arguments in order to ask the user questions and present information.
Results from the user's interaction are printed in machine parsable format,
though this format is likely to change as development continues.
.Nm
writes the result of the user interaction to standard output.
.Pp
All options to
.Nm
can be preceeded with a single or double dash (--), but neither are required.
.Sh WIDGETS
All widgets take some set of parameters to augment their behavior.
The widgets are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar menu Ar widget_title Ar items
.It Ar radio Ar widget_title Ar items
Present a list of
.Em item s
to the user.  
The menu widget allows multiple selections, and the radio only one.
.It Ar item Ar name Op item-value Ar number 
.It Ar item Ar name Op description Ar text
An element of a menu or radio widget.  
If an item has an item-value specified, it will be returned
when the item is selected.
Otherwise, the name of the item is returned.
A description provides an extended message associated with an item.
This message only appears on the widget and is not returned.
.It Ar infobox Ar widget_title
Popup a box to the user with a text message.
The user must hit the space bar to proceed.
A messagebox may be preferred since it directs the user to hit 'Ok',
instead of assuming the user knows to hit the space bar.
.It Ar msgbox Ar widget_title
Same as a infobox, but with an 'Ok' button to prompt the user to
continue.
.It Ar yesno Ar widget_title
Still similar to the above, but with Yes/No buttons.
'Yes' or 'No' is returned.
.It Ar gauge Ar widget_title Ar percent
Horizontal histogram, easily scripted into a progress bar.
.It Ar inputbox Ar widget_title
Asks the user to type a response, with Ok/Cancel buttons.
.It Ar fselect Ar directory Ar widget_title
Allow the user to navigate a directory tree and select a file via
the arrow keys.
The name of the selected file is returned.
.It Ar viewer Ar filename
Display the contents of the specified file to the user, with 'Ok'
and 'Cancel' buttons.  
Arrow keys, CTL-F, CTL-B, and the space bar
navigate. 
The selected button is returned.
.It Ar password Ar widget_title
This widget hides any text typed, making it suitable for asking for passwords.
.Pp
.It Ar inputmenu
.It Ar menubox
.It Ar textbox
.It Ar calendar
.It Ar timebox
.It Ar tailbox
Not yet implemented.

.Sh FORMATTING
Colors and formatting codes are supprted directly via the 
.Xr cdk 3
library.
For details see
.Xr cdk_display 3 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
See /usr/src/usr.bin/fdialog/tests and /usr/src/usr.bin/fdialog/samples
for copious examples.
The basic format as given to the shell is:
.Bl -tag -width findx
.It Li "$ fdialog --title \*qThis is my title\*q --radio \*q<C>This text goes over the items.\*q --item item1 --item item2 --item item3" 3>&1
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cdk 3 ,
.Xr cdk_display 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was inspired by dialog and its many variants.
Dialog is licensed under the GPL, and the desire for a totally free version
led to
.Nm fdialog .
.Pp
A 
.Nm
command appeared in
.Mx 8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An David Steinberg Aq dave@redterror.net
.Sh BUGS
Not all planned widgets are implemented.
.Pp
Certain commands have shorter synonyms, and these are not documented.
.Sh NOTES
Debug mode can be enabled by defining the FDL_DEBUG symbol.
In debug mode, /tmp/fdialog.debug is created with diagnostic information.
This info is probably only of interest to developers.
