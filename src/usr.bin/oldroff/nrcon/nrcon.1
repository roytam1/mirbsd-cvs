.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility formats text in the named
.Ar files ,
or from standard input, if none present,
for the BSD console.
Input is first pre-processed (see below), then passed through
.Xr nroff 1 ,
then post-processed and passed through
.Xr col 1
with the
.Fl x
option, in UTF-8 mode.
The full capabilities of
.Nm nroff
are described in the
.%T "Nroff/Troff User's Manual" .
.Pp
A single dash
.Pq Fl
is taken to be a file name corresponding to the standard input.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility supports all standard options of
.Nm nroff
as well as several options of its own.
Both are listed below, where
.Nm
options are marked specially.
As long as they appear before any
.Ar file
argument, the following options are recognised:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm + Ns Ar N
Start printing at page
.Ar N .
Default: 1
.It Cm - Ns Ar N
Stop printing at page
.Ar N .
Default: 10000
.It Fl B
Ignored for compatibility with
.Mx
.Xr nroff 1 .
.It Fl C Ns Ar codeset
Process input in the
.Ar codeset
encoding and write output in the same, using
.Xr iconv 3 .
This option is special to
.Nm nrcon .
Default: utf-8
.It Fl c
Ignored for compatibility with GNU groff.
.It Fl e
Produce equally-spaced words in adjusted lines, using full terminal resolution.
.It Fl h
Use 8-column-wide output tabs during horizontal spacing to speed up output and
reduce character count.
.It Fl i
Read standard input after the input files are exhausted.
.It Fl m Ns Ar name
Prepend the macro file
.Pa /usr/share/tmac/tmac. Ns Ar name
to the input
.Ar files .
.It Fl n Ns Ar N
Number first generated page
.Ar N .
.It Fl o Ns Ar list
Print only pages whose page numbers appear in the comma-separated
.Ar list
of numbers and ranges.
A range
.Ar N\-M
means pages
.Ar N
through
.Ar M ;
an initial
.Ar \-N
means from the beginning to page
.Ar N ;
a final
.Ar N\-
means from
.Ar N
to the end.
.It Fl p Ns Ar N
