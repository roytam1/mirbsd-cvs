.Sh NAME
.Nm iconv
.Nd convert between different codesets
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cs
.Op Fl f Ar fromcs
.Op Fl t Ar tocs
.Op Ar
.Nm
.Fl l
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility converts the files (or standard input, if none given) from the
encoding specified by
.Ar fromcs ,
or the current locale's character set as specified by
.Fn nl_langinfo CODESET ,
to the encoding specified by
.Ar tocs .
If
.Ar file
is a single dash
.Pq Sq \&-
or absent,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
The result is written to standard output, diagnostics and error
messages are written to standard error.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XfXfromcs
.It Fl c
Omit any characters that are invalid in the codeset of the input file
from the output.
Normally, byte sequences that are no characters in the input codeset cause
.Nm
to abort with a diagnostic message.
If
.Fl c
is given, they are still diagnosed (unless
.Fl s
is given as well) but skipped (byte-wise) on read.
.It Fl f Ar fromcs
Identify the codeset of the input file.
Processing of
.St -p1003.1-2001
Character Set Description Files is not implemented.
If this option is not given, the codeset of the current locale is used.
.It Fl l
Instead of codeset conversion, write a list of supported codesets,
separated by newline, to standard output, then exit successfully.
.It Fl s
Suppress any diagnostics written to standard error concerning invalid
characters (both in the input codeset and in the output codeset, i\.e\.
conversion information losses).
Normally, invalid input characters, files that end with an incomplete
or invalid character or shift sequence, and inconvertible characters
are reported, the latter once per file and in a final summary.
.It Fl t Ar tocs
Identify the codeset of the output file.
See
.Fl f
for semantics.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Li \$ iconv -f latin1 -t utf-8 file.txt >newfile.txt
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 on general failure, 2 if there is no known
way to convert between the codesets given, and 3 if the output buffer is
too small (implementation error, contact the developer in that case).
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr nl_langinfo 3 ,
.Xr setlocale 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to conform to
.St -susv3 .
XSI is not supported.
POSIX2_LOCALEDEF is not supported.
If neither
.Fl f
nor
.Fl t
are given, or their arguments are the same or equivalent,
input is passed through; invalid characters are not detected.
Implementation-specific behaviour is as described in this manual.
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
appeared in
.Mx 10 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility and this manual page were written by
.An Thorsten Glaser Aq tg@mirbsd.de .
.Mx
uses codeset conversion routines from the Citrus project.
.Sh CAVEATS
In the current implementation, if the output of a buffer
is more than 16 times the input buffer size, currently
64 KiB, an error is returned.
.Pp
The GNU extension of //TRANSLIT is not supported by Citrus iconv.
.Pp
Each input
.Ar file
is handled as a separate conversion unit, and the shift
state is returned to inital after processing a file.
