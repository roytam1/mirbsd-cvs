.Sh NAME
.Nm script
.Nd make typescript of terminal session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm script
.Op Fl alqsU
.Op Fl c Ar cmd
.Op Fl L|U Ar replstr
.Op Fl n | Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
opens a pseudo-tty master and starts an interactive shell
which is connected to the slave tty.
If the
.Fl n
option is not given, it
makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.
It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive
session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file
can be printed out later with
.Xr lpr 1 .
It is also useful for people who log in to a
.Mx
box with a terminal that is not UTF-8 capable,
or to connect to a non-UTF-8-capable box.
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar file
is given,
.Nm
saves all dialogue in
.Ar file .
If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file
.Pa typescript .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Append the output to
.Ar file
or
.Pa typescript ,
retaining the prior contents.
.It Fl c Ar cmd
Instead of running
.Li ${SHELL:\-/bin/sh} Fl i ,
execute
.Li ${SHELL:\-/bin/sh} Fl c Ar 'cmd' .
.It Fl L Ar replstr
Assume the terminal uses ISO-8859-1
.Pq Do latin1 Dc
encoding, and convert from and to UTF-8 for the pty.
Inconvertible characters are displayed as
.Ar replstr ,
one per column.
.It Fl l
Assume the terminal uses ISO-8859-1
.Pq Do latin1 Dc
encoding, and convert from and to UTF-8 for the pty.
Inconvertible characters are displayed as one question mark per column.
.It Fl n
Do not record a typescript.
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
.It Fl s
Start a login shell.
.It Fl U Ar replstr
Assume the session uses ISO-8859-1
.Pq Do latin1 Dc
encoding, and convert from and to UTF-8 for the pty.
Inconvertible characters are sent to the inside shell as
.Ar replstr ,
one per column.
.It Fl u
Assume the session uses ISO-8859-1
.Pq Do latin1 Dc
encoding, and convert from and to UTF-8 for the pty.
Inconvertible characters are sent to the inside shell as
one question mark per column.
.El
.Pp
The script ends when the forked shell exits (a control-D
.Pq Ql ^D
to exit
the Bourne shell
.Pf ( Xr sh 1 ) ,
and
.Ic exit ,
.Ic logout ,
or control-D
(if
.Va ignoreeof
is not set) for the
C-shell,
.Xr csh 1 ) .
.Nm
will exit with the status of 0 unless any of its child
processes fail.
In which case,
.Nm
will return 1.
.Pp
Certain interactive commands, such as
.Xr vi 1 ,
create garbage in the typescript file.
.Nm
works best with commands that do not manipulate the
screen; the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width SHELL
.It Ev SHELL
Name of the shell to be forked by
.Nm script .
If not set, the Bourne shell is assumed.
(Most shells set this variable automatically.)
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Li $ script
.Pp
Records a typescript of an interactive session.
.Pp
.Li $ script -ln
.Pp
Runs a UTF-8 session inside an ISO-8859-1 hardware terminal.
.Pa /usr/ports/misc/screen
can do even more, but is not part of
.Mx .
.Pp
.Li $ luit -encoding 'ISO 8859-1' -- ssh remote
.Pp
Run inside the UTF-8 session, connects to a remote system
which uses ISO-8859-1 encoding and ISO 2022 shift sequences.
.Pp
.Li $ script -unc ssh remote
.Pp
This is the same, without luit.
ISO-8859-1 for the inside is hard-coded.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr luit 1 ,
.Xr screen 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
Support for recoding between latin1 and utf-8 appeared in
.Mx 10 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The recoding, execute shell command code, and codeset support
was authored by
.An Thorsten Glaser Aq tg@mirbsd.de .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
places
.Em everything
in the log file, including linefeeds and backspaces.
This is not what the naive user expects.
.Pp
While double-width characters are presented as two times the
.Ar replstr ,
combining characters are hidden.
.Xr xterm 1
does some sort of precomposing and then displays them together
as single character, or, as replacement if it stands \- cf.\&
.Pa /usr/src/contrib/samples/utf-8
\&\- alone.
.Nm
just doesn't display them at all.
GNU screen has a different, also slightly broken, logic and
has even worse width behaviour in that file, but replaces
unicode line-drawing characters with their ACS equivalents.
