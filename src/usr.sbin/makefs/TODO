$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.6 2002/02/06 02:17:14 lukem Exp $

todo
----

- display block numbers for a given file (e.g, /boot)

- finish makefs.8

- testing

- even more testing

- add support for converting a tar file (instead of a directory tree);
  suggested by kpneal@pobox.com


outstanding bugs
----------------

- size estimation is still out (need to take into account indirect blocks!)

- parameter checking when density is rather high or low.

- filling up a file system (running out of inodes or whatever)
  doesn't do the right thing.


discuss
-------

- consider replacing ffs_balloc() et al with own code that doesn't
  need hacked-up buf.c code

- whacking on newfs/mkfs.c to allow .PATH-ing directly into makefs(8).
  this would involve passing all of mkfs()'s parameters in a single
  struct rather than a lot of global vars, etc.
