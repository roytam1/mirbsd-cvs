/*
 * fake library for ssh v6 enabler patch
 *
 * This file includes getnameinfo().
 * These funtions are defined in rfc2133.
 *
 * But these functions are not implemented correctly. The minimum subset
 * is implemented for ssh use only. For exapmle, this routine assumes
 * that ai_family is AF_INET. Don't use it for another purpose.
 *
 * In the case not using 'configure --enable-ipv6', this getnameinfo.c
 * will be used if you have broken getnameinfo or no getnameinfo.
