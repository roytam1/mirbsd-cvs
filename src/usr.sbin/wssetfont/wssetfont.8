.Sh NAME
.Nm wssetfont
.Nd Set the font for a wscons display device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wssetfont
.Op Fl c Ar cfgdev
.Op Fl t Ar ttydev
.Op name | Fl s Ar slot
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm wssetfont
utility set the specified console to use a font previously loaded with the
.Xr wsfontload 8
utility.
The font is specified either by
.Ar name
or by using the
.Fl s Ar slot
option.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar cfgdev
Specify the control device of the wscons display to operate on.
Default is
.Pa /dev/ttyCcfg .
.It Fl t Ar ttydev
Specify the name of the tty console device to operate on.
Default is the current console, i.e. the terminal device
currently open on STDIN, as would be returned by
.Xr tty 1 .
.It Fl s Ar slot
Specify to use the font currently loaded in
.Ar slot .
.El
.Pp
If neither a
.Ar name
or the
.Fl s Ar slot
option are given, the built in font for the device will be used.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl # wsfontload -N myfont -e iso /usr/share/misc/pcvt/vt220l.816
.Dl # wssetfont -t /dev/ttyC0 myfont
.Pp
Load a font from the pcvt directory, and set the first console to use
this font.
.Pp
.Dl # wssetfont
.Pp
Set the current console back to the default built in font.

.Sh HISTORY

appeared in
.Mx 8 .
.Sh BUGS
If two fonts are given the same name when loaded, and both are valid
for the current screen type, the first font will always be chosen,
even if the
.Fl s Ar slot
option is used.
.Pp
Some devices may support the use of multiple fonts; this utility does
not provide a method of setting more than one font for a given device.
