.Sh NAME
.Nm vnconfig
.Nd "configure vnode disks for file swapping or pseudo file systems"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl vkr
.Op Fl f Ar keyfile
.Ar rawdev
.Ar regular_file
.Nm
.Fl u
.Op Fl v
.Ar rawdev
.Nm
.Fl l
.Op Ar rawdev
.Nm
.Fl K Ar algorithm
.Fl f Ar keyfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures vnode pseudo disk devices.
It will associate (or disassociate) the special file
.Ar rawdev
with the regular file
.Ar regular_file
allowing the latter to be accessed as though it were a disk.
Hence a regular file within the filesystem can be used for swapping
or can contain a filesystem that is mounted in the name space.
Both traditional devices,
.Pa vnd ,
and the cache-coherent devices,
.Pa svnd ,
are configured through
.Nm vnconfig .
.Pp
If you read the regular file while using
.Pa svnd ,
you need to mount the
.Pa svnd
with the mount option
.Ar sync
to ensure consistency in the buffer cache.
For normal operation this is not necessary.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Configures the device.
If successful, references to
.Ar rawdev
will access the contents of
.Ar regular_file .
This is the default operation.
.It Fl f Ar keyfile
Instead of an encryption key read from stdin, an ASN.1 octet string
will be decoded from the PEM format
.Ar keyfile .
This option implies
.Fl k .
.It Fl k
Associate an encryption key with the device.
All data will be encrypted using the Blowfish cipher before it is
written to the disk.
Encryption only works with
.Pa svnd .
.It Fl K Ar algorithm
Generate a PEM format keyfile containing an encrypted ASN.1
octet string which can be used as keyfile for further invocations of
.Nm
.Fl kf .
The ASN.1 octet string contains 448 random bits gained from use of
.Xr arc4random 3 .
The
.Ar algorithm
can be chosen from the default
.Xr openssltool 1
list.
.It Fl l
List the vnd devices and indicate which ones are in use.
If a specific
.Ar rawdev
is given, then only that one will be described.
.It Fl r
If the kernel supports it, don't write to the underlying file.
This is supported since
.Mx 7 .
.It Fl u
Unconfigures the device.
.It Fl v
Print messages to stdout describing actions taken.
.El
.Pp
If no action option is given,
.Fl c
is assumed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/rvnd?? -compact
.It Pa /dev/{,r}{,s}vnd*
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configure the vnode disk
.Pa svnd0
(all of its partitions become usable):
.Pp
.Dl # vnconfig svnd0 /tmp/diskimage
.Pp
Unconfigure the same device:
.Pp
.Dl # vnconfig -u svnd0
.Pp
Show a list of supported
.Em Cipher Types :
.Pp
.Dl $ openssl enc -

.Xr openssltool 1 ,
.Xr arc4random 3 ,
.Xr blowfish 3 ,
.Xr vnd 4 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr swapon 8 ,
.Xr umount 8
.Sh HISTORY
Support for external keyfiles was added in
.Mx 9 .
.Sh BUGS
This command should really be named
.Nm vndconfig .
