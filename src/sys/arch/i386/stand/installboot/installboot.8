.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm installboot
is used to install a
.Dq first-stage
boot program into the boot area
of an FFS disk partition, and initialize the table of block numbers the
PBR programme uses to load the second-stage boot program.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag_opt
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Be verbose, printing out the LBA addresses that are to be stored in
.Ar ldsec
along with lots of other information.
.It Fl s Ar sectors-per-track
Used to specify the sectors-per-track value if the drive has
sector translation activated, and
.Nm
is unable to determine the translated geometry.
.\" If not specified, this defaults to d_nsectors from the disklabel.
If not specified, this defaults to the value retrieved from the BIOS
at boot time, available via
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.It Fl h Ar tracks-per-cyl
Used to specify the tracks-per-cylinder value if the drive has
sector translation activated, and
.Nm
is unable to determine the translated geometry.
.\" If not specified, this defaults to d_ntracks from the disklabel.
If not specified, this defaults to the value retrieved from the BIOS
at boot time, available via
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.It Fl P Ar partition-type
Use the
.Ar partition-type
value in decimal (on
.Mx
also sedecimal or octal values are allowed, provided
they are prefixed with 0x or 0, respectively) as user-specified
partition type to search before the standard 0x27 and the fallback
0xA6, 0xA9 and 0xA5 types.
.It Fl M
Installs the first-stage boot loader,
.Nm ldsec ,
into the master boot record.
The partition table does not get overwritten.
The
.Pa /boot
file had better be not too fragmented for this to work.
This option is not yet supported.
.It Fl I
Instead of installing the first-stage boot loader on a disc,
write it to the beginning of an ISO 9660 image file.
The arguments
.Ar bootstart
and
.Ar bootend
are ISO sectors (2048 bytes each) as given in the
.Xr mkisofs 8
verbose output format.
.Pp
Example:
.Pp
.Dl # /usr/mdec/installboot -v -I 94376 94396 /usr/mdec/ldsec livecd8.iso
.Pp
Note:
If you use the
.Fl boot-info-table
option of
.Xr mkisofs 8 ,
the resulting bootloader (i.e. the
.Fl b Ar eltorito_boot_image
argument to
.Nm mkisofs )
cannot be used to boot the same image from hard disc any more.
Use another copy of the second-stage loader.
.It Fl i
Instead of installing the first-stage boot loader on a disc,
write it to the beginning of a hard disc image file.
The arguments
.Ar bootstart
and
.Ar bootlen
are hard disc sectors (512 bytes each).
.Pp
Example:
.Pp
.Dl # /usr/mdec/installboot -v -i 1000 82 /usr/mdec/ldsec hda.ima
.Pp
Support for porting this to GNU/Linux welcome; contact
.An Thorsten Glaser Aq tg@mirbsd.de .
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width biosboot
.It Ar boot
The name of the second-stage boot program in the mounted file system
where the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
This should be a full pathname.
.It Ar ldsec
The name of the prototype file for the first stage boot program,
usually
.Pa /usr/mdec/ldsec .
.It Ar disk
The name of the disk containing the partition in which the second-stage
boot program resides and the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
This can either be specified in short form (i.e.,
.Sq sd0
or
.Sq wd0 ) ,
or as the explicit raw device node, such as
.Pa /dev/rsd0c
or
.Pa /dev/rwd0c .
.Pp
Note that you must be in single-user mode or have your kernel in
insecure mode (see the
.Xr sysctl 8
.Va kern.securelevel
variable or
.Pa /etc/rc.securelevel )
to enable access to the raw partition of a mounted disk.
.Pp
The
.Sq c
partition is always used to represent the
.Dq entire
disk on i386.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The typical use is
.Pp
.Dl # cp /usr/mdec/boot /boot
.Dl # /usr/mdec/installboot -v -n /boot /usr/mdec/ldsec wd0
.Pp
And if the information supplied looks right, run the above without the
.Fl n
flag.
If you are upgrading an old system, you may need to preface
the above steps with some more steps... and do the following:
.Pp
.Dl boot the floppy.fs filesystem floppy
.Dl # fsck /dev/rsd0a
.Dl # mount /dev/sd0a /mnt
.Dl # cp /usr/mdec/boot /mnt/boot
.Dl # /usr/mdec/installboot -v /mnt/boot /usr/mdec/ldsec sd0
.Pp
If you need to find the BIOS geometry of the disk for
.Fl s
and
.Fl h
you can use the boot block command:
.Pp
.Dl boot> machine diskinfo
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr fdisk 8 ,
.Xr init 8
.Sh BUGS
The disklabel
.Va d_type
field must be set to a value of
.Dq 4.2FFS .
.Pp
You cannot run
.Nm installboot
for a drive/partition other than the one you want the
.Pa /boot
to be loaded from.
.Pp
Both the
.Fl I
and
.Fl i
options require the
.Pa /boot
programme to be present in one piece, i.e. not fragmented.
