# sun4:
#	The first 8MB of physical memory are mapped 1:1.
# sun4c:
#	Worst case sun4c systems have their memory in non-contiguous 4MB
#	areas, therefore we must ensure the boot code never crosses a 4MB
#	boundary.
#	A SPARCstation IPC with 12MB memory in 1MB SIMMs, running PROM 2.9,
#	only maps virtual memory up to 0x3aefff.
# sun4m:
#	The minimal contiguous memory area will be 8MB (SS4/SS5 8MB DIMMs),
#	but there is no guarantee anything will be mapped at address zero
#	if the DIMM are set in a pathological (dis)order, as in:
#		ok cd /memory
#		ok .attributes
#		reg                      00000000  08000000  00800000

#		available                00000000  0e000000  007a6000
#		                         00000000  0c000000  00800000
#		                         00000000  0a000000  00800000
#		                         00000000  08000000  00800000
#		name                     memory
#	where the four 8MB DIMMs are mapped at 32MB intervals from 128MB
#	onwards.
# sun4d:
#	Similar to sun4m, but the minimal contiguous memory area will be 32MB,
#	and all physical memory will be packed contiguous from address zero
#	onwards.

# The following values of RELOC and RELOC2 have been choosen to work on as
