.\" * ` generates ‘ in groff, so use \`
.\" * ' generates ’ in groff, \' generates ´, so use \*(aq
.\" * - generates ‐ in groff, \- generates −, see above (instead of −)
.\"   thus use - for hyphens and \- for minus signs and option dashes
.\" * ~ is size-reduced and placed atop in groff, so use \*(TI
.\" * ^ is size-reduced and placed atop in groff, so use \*(ha
.\" * \(en does not work in nroff, so use \*(en

.ds aq \(aq
.ds TI \(ti
