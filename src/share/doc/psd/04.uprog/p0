This paper is an introduction to programming on
the
.UX
system.
The emphasis is on how to write programs that interface
to the operating system,
either directly or through the standard I/O library.
The topics discussed include
.IP "  \(bu"
handling command arguments
.IP "  \(bu"
rudimentary I/O; the standard input and output
.IP "  \(bu"
the standard I/O library; filesystem access
.IP "  \(bu"
low-level I/O: open, read, write, close, seek
.IP "  \(bu"
processes: exec, fork, pipes
.IP "  \(bu"
signals \(em interrupts, etc.
.PP
There is also an appendix which describes
the standard I/O library in detail.
