The documents in this directory consist of various, miscellaneous, system docs:

	legal/		Licences and associated information
	html/		HTML documents for bind, curses, and lynx
	psd/		UNIX Programmer's Supplementary Documents
	smm/		UNIX System Manager's Manuals
	usd/		UNIX User's Supplementary Documents

The documentation in the psd, smm, and usd subdirectories are roff source,
and can be used to generate documents in any of the formats available to the
troff(1) document formatting system.

Within any given subdirectory, simply typing:

	# make paper.ps

will generate a pre-formatted document in PostScript format, called `paper.ps'.
The document can be viewed with the help of a PostScript viewer, such as
`ghostview' or `gv', and the PostScript back-end `ghostscript'. See ports(7)
and packages(7) for further information on how to install this software.
The generation of postscript output needs an installed troff or GNU groff text
formatter, none of which is part of the MirOS system.

ASCII text format documents, suitable for viewing with a pager such as
less(1), can be generated by typing:

	# make paper.txt

However, the PostScript output is much prettier :)

The documentation in the html subdirectory can by viewed using any HTML-capable
browser such as lynx(1).


This is also the place for known cryptographic information. We use gzsig(1)
to sign our distfiles; the keys shown below are used for this purpose only.
Please do not use them in any other way, such as SSH logins.
