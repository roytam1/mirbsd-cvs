MirOS base system and BSD - TOU
-------------------------------

This is /usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE, available online under
<http://mirbsd.bsdadvocacy.org/cvs.cgi/src/share/doc/legal/>
or any other CVSweb enabled mirror.

This file contains the terms and conditions which MirOS base
and MirOS BSD are covered under.

The MirOS Project consists of a loosely bound group of deve-
lopers of which most are Europe-based, some in Canada or USA
and some other places of the world; these developers work on
MirOS together as "committers" (people with direct write ac-
cess to MirOS) and former committers (together, authors), as
well as "contributors" who submit patches or help otherwise.
MirBSD is defined as the content of the MirOS Project's lea-
der's /usr/src and /usr/ports directories; usually MirOS BSD
and MirPorts.

For an overview of all other terms and conditions that cover
parts of MirOS, refer to the file 1stREAD in the current di-
rectory.

The MirOS Project strives to make as much of our work as po-
ssible, as well as inherited work we redistribute, available
under OSD compliant licences (see www.opensource.org), where
OSI certification is not a need.

We ask all of our contributors to publish their work under a
licence boilerplate derived from the "licence.template" file
and request them to always use the disclaimer shown in this,
even if contributor is not bound by EU law, and accepts that
he is liable for knowingly inserted work or malice intent as
well as for integrating work which other parties have rights
but we no licence. We also ask all contributors to be either
at least 18 years old, or at least 7 years old and have been
given by their parents a generic permit to do business rela-
ted to open source software (or at least specific to MirOS),
which makes them fully contractually capable for this speci-
fic area of deals. Contributor is responsible to provide the
parental statement, in non-electronic form, giving this all-
owance, or a proof of age, on request.
With the knowledge every committer accepts certain liability
we indemnify our official mirrors from any claims arising of
the fact they are mirroring MirOS material, and ask projects
hosted by us to fully indemnify us and our official mirrors,
too.
