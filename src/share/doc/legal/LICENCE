MirOS base system and BSD - TOU
-------------------------------

This is /usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE, available online at
http://cvs.mirbsd.de/src/share/doc/legal/ or any other
CVSweb-enabled mirror.

This file contains the terms and conditions which MirOS base
and MirOS BSD are covered under.

The MirOS Project consists of a loosely bound group of deve-
lopers of which most are Europe-based, some in Canada or USA
and some other places of the world; these developers work on
MirOS together as "committers" (people with direct write ac-
cess to MirOS) and former committers (together, authors), as
well as "contributors" who submit patches or help otherwise.
MirBSD is defined as the content of the MirOS Project's lea-
der's /usr/src and /usr/ports directories; usually MirOS BSD
and MirPorts; thus, MirOS is derived from MirBSD(tm).

# MirOS is Copyright (c) 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006
#		The MirOS Project <miros-dev@MirBSD.org>
# and its contributors.
#
# Licensee is hereby permitted to deal in this work without restric-
# tion, including unlimited rights to use, publicly perform, modify,
# merge, distribute, sell, give away or sublicence, provided all co-
# pyright notices above, these terms and the disclaimer are retained
# in all redistributions or reproduced in accompanying documentation
# or other materials provided with binary redistributions.
#
# Licensor offers the work "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY of any kind,
# express, or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
# law, without malicious intent or gross negligence; in no event may
# licensor, an author or contributor be held liable for any indirect
# or other damage, or direct damage except proven a consequence of a
# direct error of said person and intended use of this work, loss or
# other issues arising in any way out of its use, even if advised of
# the possibility of such damage or existence of a nontrivial bug.

The following people are MirOS developers:
* Thorsten Glaser <tg@66h.42h.de>
* Benny Siegert <bsiegert@gmx.de>


For an overview of all other terms and conditions that cover
parts of MirOS, refer to the file 1stREAD in the current di-
rectory and the files it refers to.

The MirOS Project strives to make as much of our work as po-
ssible, as well as inherited work we redistribute, available
under OSD compliant licences (see www.opensource.org), where
OSI certification is not a requirement, due to braindead po-
licies of OSI.
We strongly request people to not reuse our work in material
covered by problematic licences such as the GNU FDL.

We ask all of our contributors to publish their work under a
licence boilerplate derived from the "licence.template" file
and request them to always use the disclaimer shown in this,
even if contributor is not bound by EU law.
We also ask all contributors to be: either at least 18 years
old, or at least 7 years old and have been given a parental,
generic permit to do business related to open source softwa-
re (or at least specific to MirOS), which enables them to be
fully contractually capable for this specific area of deals.
Contributor is responsible to provide the parental statement
in non-electronic form, giving this permission, if required,
and a proof of age, on request.
