Special rules for GNU and similar less free software
====================================================

Non-GNU software
----------------

Some software comes under GPL (lynx, mkisofs, perl) or
different licences (sendmail, perl). For GPL software,
the "Obtaining source code" section below applies. For
sendmail, it applies similarily.

GNU software
------------

Some software comes under GPL with documentation under
either GPL or GFDL, and requires copyright assignment,
namely: autotools, binutils, cvs, gcc, rcs, texinfo

The section "Obtaining source code" below applies. The
GNU software parts are however not covered by the col-
lective copyright on MirOS asserted by the founder. We
also ask any contributor to this part of the source to
assign back the US style copyright to the FSF. Europe-
an droit d'auteur rights are retained.


GNU FDL
-------

The MirOS project goals forbid distributing code - this does
not exclude documentation - which we cannot modify.

The GNU Free Documentation License has been deemed non-free,
unless neither cover texts nor invariant sections are speci-
fied - this is, however, not the case with the documents in-
cluded, thus we have decided to delete them.

Update: even in the case neither front nor back cover texts,
nor invariant sections are specified, the GFDL is considered
non-free: http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html

cf. http://people.debian.org/%7Esrivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml

If you don't like the fact, contact your local FSF represen-
tative, or the FSF Europe or USA.

Compromise
----------

Currently, we are delivering GNU software bundled with MirOS
and do not exclude documentation. RMS has assured we can re-
distribute the GFDL-licenced parts in our CVS repository and
on CDs, via SSH, in a non-world-readable or encrypted direc-
tory. See: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?m=113699292525210

All copyright on the changes is assigned back to the FSF, so
there is not much we can do about it. In order to fulfil the
licence's requirements, there is always the original version
available at the CVSweb of "sources.redhat.com", and the mo-
dified and original versions are visible via MirOS CVSweb as
shown below.

We urge people to not licence their work under GNU FDL, pre-
vent people from relicencing our own documentation under it,
e.g. in the website licence, when possible, and ask them not
to do it otherwise. We must live with the FSF documentation,
but we do not allow committers to modify them unless changes
are assigned back to the FSF, to prevent additional require-
ments to burden us.


GNU GPL
-------

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/29c7588fbecd8289
and at http://www.symlink.ch/articles/06/12/18/1515227.shtml (German)

Despite FSF propaganda (FUD), the GNU GPL is not a viral li-
cence if you do not redistribute the end product of combina-
ting some work with a GPL licenced work. Dynamic linking and
dlopen(3) are not combining, as they are brought together at
run time only. GPLv2 section 0 says the act of running isn't
restricted. Mere aggregation of GPL and non-GPL work on some
medium (e.g. our installation sets) don't "infect" either.

The ChangeLog requirement is met by CVS logs (both the files
and the logs within the ,v files themselves). The source can
be obtained for free from our CVSweb unless distributed with
the MirOS release/snapshot you obtained. Note that the bina-
ries you receive need not correspond to the source code (for
non-GPL binaries only).

GPLv3
-----

We do not yet have a stance on the GPLv3, because it has not
yet been released. We however hope that there will not be an
additional liability or responsibility burdened upon us.


Obtaining source code
---------------------

On your MirOS Release CD, source code for the base system is
at /v{version}/source{version}.ngz and xfree{version}.ngz; a
link is placed in the machine-dependent subdirectories to be
able to easily install them.

Third-party sources for Release, Snapshot or Live CDs can be
obtained from /v{version}/[Dd]istfiles, or /[Dd]istfiles, or
/v{version}/[Dd]ist, or /[Dd]ist, if existent. Live CDs come
with the source code of packages pre-installed, unless these
have distfiles placed on the HTTP mirror(s), see below.

Source code for less free software that comes with MirOS, as
listed above, is available via CVSweb, anonCVS, or anonRSYNC
as described below.

Distfiles not on the distribution media
---------------------------------------

According to the GNU General Public License (Version 2), Section
3b, we hereby guarantee that, unless the required source code is
available on the same media (as per Section 3a), it shall be ac-
cessible to the general public on our HTTP download mirrors, for
at least three years after the initial release date of the media
and at no cost other than the expense of physically distributing
these files. Because HTTP mirrors is the medium customarily used
for software interchange, when it comes to "distfiles" of ports,
we do not offer any other means, unless the mirrors are not wor-
king. However, if you want the complete material downloadable at
our mirrors on fixed media, contact us and we'll send them, at a
little extra fee, to you, as an additional service going further
than what the GPL requires.

Distfiles covered by other licences shall be treated similarily.
