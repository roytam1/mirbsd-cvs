Readme for GNU software on MirOS
================================

This file covers the most frequently asked questions about
the GNU tools which are contributational part of the MirOS
base installation. It also does cover legal requirements.


Documentation
-------------

Do you wonder where the documentation is?

Well, the Free Software Foundation USA has ensured we cannot
distribute the documentation enclosed with gcc 3.4.5 because
of licence issues.

(However, see below, there is a compromise.)

The MirOS project goals forbid distributing code - this does
not exclude docs - which we cannot modify.

The GNU Free Documentation License has been deemed non-free,
unless neither cover texts nor invariant sections are speci-
fied - this is, however, not the case with the documents in-
cluded, thus we have decided to delete them.

Update: even in the case neither front nor back cover texts,
nor invariant sections are specified, the GFDL is considered
non-free: http://home.twcny.rr.com/nerode/neroden/fdl.html

cf. http://people.debian.org/%7Esrivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml

If you don't like the fact, contact your local FSF represen-
tative, or the FSF Europe or USA.


Compromise
----------

Currently, we are delivering GCC with documentation as tool,
contributed alongside MirOS but not part of it. GNU binutils
are, however, contained in the MirOS base system, and we are
including documentation.

All copyright on the changes is assigned back to the FSF, so
there is not much we can do about it. In order to fulfil the
licence's requirements, there is always the original version
available at the CVSweb of "sources.redhat.com", and the mo-
dified and original versions are visible via MirOS CVSweb as
shown below.

The collective copyright assigned onto the whole of MirOS by
Thorsten Glaser as project leader does *not* cover the parts
licenced under any version of the GNU FDL.


Libraries under the GNU GPL without linking exception clause
------------------------------------------------------------

While building the base system, you'll see apparently weird-
looking messages, such as
objdump.o: Linking with libopcodes infects with the GNU General Public License!
objdump.o: Linking with libbfd infects with the GNU General Public License!
objdump.o: Linking with libiberty infects with the GNU General Public License!

We have tried to identify any potential source of GPL poiso-
ning in the MirOS source tree, and have started to do so for
MirPorts. If you should encounter these or similar infection
warning messages, this is informational - the actual licence
virus only gets active if the final, linked, binary is redi-
stributed. If we should have missed to identify a GPL'd lib-
rary which is installed during the release process, or you'd
like to help us with modifying MirPorts the same way, please
contact us immediately.


The ChangeLog requirement of the GNU GPL
----------------------------------------

Our changelogs are CVS, and the old ones from GNU
are retrievable via CVS:

anoncvs access with ssh:

	Port: 2022
	empty password

anonymous rsync access:
	- via rsync protocol
	rsync://rsync.allbsd.org/mirbsd-cvs/
	rsync://rsync.allbsd.org/mirbsd-old-cvs/

Licence blurb
-------------
Every single GNU-licensed (GPL, LGPL, etc.) file in this directory
is covered by the licence in the lowest possible version that is
written in the file, and relicensing files taken from MirOS under
later versions of e.g. the GPL (when the original file is, say,
GPLv1'd) is prohibited. You may of course ask the MirOS development
team, which will decide on a case by case basis. For some projects,
we are trying to assign back the copyright to the FSF (for practical
reasons, ignoring political problems); for these files this restriction
does not apply unless it's stated in the copyright header itself.

To remove GNU FDL licenced material we have been forced (see the above
blurb about documentation). This is a consensus that has been discussed
on the debian-legal mailing list. MirBSD, MirLinux (MirOS) strive to be
DFSG-free operating systems, with MirPorts being only a defined way to
locally add third-party packages (itself BSD-style licenced as well),
thus we took the consequence and removed GFDL-licenced documentation
from the installed base system and, where feasible, from the source,
except as described above.


Other particulars
-----------------

$OpenBSD: README,v 1.1 2001/08/18 13:12:57 espie Exp $

Some of the software in this subtree follows special rules.

Specifically, the FSF not only wants the GPL licence, but they
also insist that you assign your copyright to the FSF for anything
but trivial changes.

So:
- check the history of external code before importing it.
- be ready to arrange for copyright papers somewhat in advance if
you want to work on it (the FSF takes a few months to process these).

Otherwise, changes might not make it to the main distribution, and may
need some further maintenance over time, or risk getting lost.

Some internal changes are acceptable, but OpenBSD can't afford to maintain
a complete separate toolchain on its own.


Assigning copyright back to the FSF
-----------------------------------

The FSF demands this for accepting patches, and demands the agreement
be made under US law. Contributor retains his moral rights under European
"Droit d'Auteur" style law.

The following MirOS committers and contributors have standing
copyright assignments with the FSF:
- tg@ (Thorsten Glaser)
	* all of src/gnu/
	* all of gcc/

Of the following persons related to MirOS/OpenBSD this is known, too:
- espie@openbsd.org (Marc Espie)
- etoh@openbsd.org (Hiroaki Etoh) - acceptance pending
- kettenis@openbsd.org (Mark Kettenis) - pending
