AC_DEFUN([gl_BISON],
[
dnl All this cruft, which tries to fail harmlessly when bison is not present,
dnl will no longer be necessary after we require an Automake release 1.10 or
dnl later, as those avoid generating .c files from .y when not in maintainer
dnl mode.  This is currently a fork from the GNULIB version of this file.
  # getdate.y works with bison only.
  AM_MISSING_PROG(YACC, bison -y)
  AC_ARG_VAR(YACC,
[The `Yet Another C Compiler' implementation to use.  Defaults to `bison -y'.
Values other than `bison -y' will most likely break on most systems.])
  AC_ARG_VAR(YFLAGS,
[YFLAGS contains the list arguments that will be passed by default to Bison.
This script will default YFLAGS to the empty string to avoid a default value of
`-d' given by some make applications.])
