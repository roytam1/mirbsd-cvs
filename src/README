$MirOS: src/README,v 1.5 2007/01/26 20:41:34 tg Exp $

This is the MirOS base BSD derived operating system,
kernel and userland, by The MirOS Project – http://mirbsd.de/

MirOS BSD is structured as follows:
 * MirOS BSD kernel: sys/
    A BSD-licenced uniprocessor operating system kernel
    for i386 (and amd64 in 32-bit mode) and (32-bit) sparc CPUs
 * MirOS userland: bin/ include/ lib/ libexec/ sbin/ usr.bin/ usr.sbin/
   and supplemental information: etc/ share/
    A BSD-licenced or similar userland for the MirOS BSD
    and other UNIX®-like operating system kernels
 * MirOS non-free section: gnu/
    Software which is part of the MirOS userland but not
    as freely licenced as the BSD heritage (e.g. GNU, Sendmail, Perl)
 * MirOS release engineering: distrib/ scripts/
    Tools for creating a formal MirOS release

MirOS userland is not entirely self-hosted: the C compiler
is missing. MirOS currently uses the GNU Compiler Collection,
which cannot entirely be built using tools from MirOS itself
(most notably, the Ada compiler needs itself to build, and the
whole thing wants GNU make) nor is it free enough (there are
licencing implications on some run-time libraries, and the
documentation is covered by the GFDL) or fits into the goal
of being a small, modern operating system. That's why gcc is
not part of MirOS, but contributed on the same media with it.

There is no code for an implementation of the X-Windowing
System either; XFree86™ is contributed similarily to gcc,
but only for size and practical reasons, since it's free.

Licencing information can be found in /usr/share/doc/legal/
after installation. Wir sind verpeilt und garantieren nichts;
wer unsere Releases verwendet, ist selber schuld.
