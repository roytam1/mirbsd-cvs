$MirOS$

This is the MirOS base BSD derived operating system,
kernel and userland, by The MirOS Project - http://mirbsd.de/

MirOS BSD is structured as follows:
 * MirOS BSD kernel: sys/
    A BSD-licenced uniprocessor operating system kernel
    for i386, amd64, sparc and macppc CPUs
 * MirOS userland: bin/ include/ lib/ libexec/ sbin/ usr.bin/ usr.sbin/
   and supplemental information: etc/ share/
    A BSD-licenced or similar userland for the MirOS BSD
    and other kernels
 * MirOS non-free section: gnu/
    Software which is part of the MirOS userland but not
    as freely licenced as the BSD heritage (e.g. GNU, Sendmail, Perl)
 * MirOS release engineering: distrib/
    Tools for creating a formal MirOS release

MirOS userland is not entirely self-hosted: the C compiler
is missing. MirOS currently uses the GNU Compiler Collection,
which cannot entirely be built using tools from MirOS itself
(most notably, the Ada compiler needs itself to build, and the
whole thing wants GNU make) nor is it free enough (there are
licencing implications on some run-time libraries, and the
documentation is licenced under the GNU FDL, which prevents
us from redistributing it) or fits into the project's goal
of being a small, modern operating system. That's why gcc is
not part of MirOS, but contributed on the same media with it.

GNU binutils, however, are part of MirOS. For more practical
reasons, their documentation is included with the base MirOS
installation, covered by the terms of the GNU FDL which are
not free enough to meet our goals. Since it is practically
impossible to remove the documentation and provide it as an
external file without losing maintainability, we have chosen
this compromise, following the Debian project's compromise
for releasing Debian 3.1 timely.

There is no code for an implementation of the X-Windowing
System either; XFree86(TM) is contributed similarily to gcc,
but only for size and practical reasons, since it's free.

after installation.
