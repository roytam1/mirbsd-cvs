# Absolute minimum Simtec EntropyKey driver: just requests encrypted
# frames and, for lack of anything better to do with them, puts them
# into /dev/wrandom (at "wire" speed, though). Rekeying is frequent,
# every 32±16 seconds, and uses host-random nonces. Call this script
# with no argument; it will auto-detect the last eKey inserted. Kill
# the script and its sleep subprocess but NEVER the cu coprocess, as
# that may freeze/hang your machine! (BTST)
