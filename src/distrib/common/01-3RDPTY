Declaration of third-party sources
==================================


MirOS
-----

The complete source code for MirOS can be found via the AnonCVS,
AnonRSYNC and CVSweb access to the MirOS Project's repositories,
which is documented appropriately on the pages of the project or
this distribution. The freely (i.e. BSD/MIT or similar) licenced
parts of the operating system need not have corresponding source
version in the repository for "special edition" media.


MirPorts
--------

If any packages are installed, and their licence requires that a
copy of the source code or other material be available, it shall
be placed either in /distfiles, /Distfiles, /v+([0-9])/distfiles
or /v+([0-9])/Distfiles, or in a directory of the same name, but
the "files" removed, on this medium, or, if this is not feasible
for space constraints, and the licence allows this, see below.

Distfiles not on the distribution media
---------------------------------------

According to the GNU General Public License (Version 2), Section
3b, we hereby guarantee that, unless the required source code is
available on the same media (as per Section 3a), it shall be ac-
cessible to the general public on our HTTP download mirrors, for
at least three years after the initial release date of the media
and at no cost other than the expense of physically distributing
these files. Because HTTP mirrors is the medium customarily used
for software interchange, when it comes to "distfiles" of ports,
we do not offer any other means, unless the mirrors are not wor-
king. However, if you want the complete material downloadable at
our mirrors on fixed media, contact us and we'll send them, at a
little extra fee, to you, as an additional service going further
than what the GPL requires.

Distfiles covered by other licences shall be treated similarily.


Unfree material
---------------

We reserve the right to populate the media with additional mate-
rial which is not freely redistributable if we have acquired the
licence to do so. This applies to "contributed files" not placed
in a directory with other files, amended by a README documenting
the terms for them, or to packages preinstalled via the MirPorts
Framework on a Live CD, which will be documented both in a file,
called NONFREE.TXT in the top-level directory of the medium, and
during the Live CD boot process. No other occurrences of unfree,
or otherwise restricted, material shall appear on the media, un-
less noted below. Note that distribution outside of Germany, due
to licence, patent, or other issues, is not considered unless we
distribute the CD ourselves (e.g. at FOSDEM in Bruxelles, Belgi-
um, in which case use and distribution in Germany and Belgium is
a required criterium).
