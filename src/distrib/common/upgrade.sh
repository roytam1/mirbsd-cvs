The fstab is configured as follows:

$(</tmp/fstab)

For the $MODE, filesystems in the fstab will be automatically mounted if the
'noauto' option is absent, and /sbin/mount_<fstype> is found, and the fstype is
not nfs or mfs. Non-ffs filesystems will be mounted read-only.

You can edit the fstab now, before it is used, but the edited fstab will only
be used during the upgrade. It will not be copied back to disk.
