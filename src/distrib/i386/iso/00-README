Setup CD for MirOS/i386
=======================

This CD provides you with the standard MirOS GENERIC kernel as well
as a small ramdisk image from which you can install or upgrade a
MirOS installation and do some basic repair tasks. Also included is
an ssh client and server for remote control and some useful tools.

For further information on how to set up MirOS, please go to our
website - http://MirBSD.org/ - and read the installation documents.


About MirBSD
============

MirBSD is not a project, it is, by definition, the contents of _my_
/usr/src and /usr/ports directories. I am Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser,
nice to meet you. I hope to be able to help you by making this project
available to the general public.

This is MirOS BSD, a community-developed successor of MirBSD®, developed
by a few individuals around the world (mostly Europe, but also Canada
and the rest of America). MirOS is open source software, although not
OSI certified open source software (which is a trademark of The Open
Source Initiative).

If this is a boot image for a MirOS development snapshot, just boot
from the CD and start hacking. Please be sure to report problems, and
consider to send unified diffs for stuff you fixed.

If this is a formal release, the directory where you are reading this
file from also contains checksums of the installation sets (*.ngz) and
kernels (bsd*). You can check them from within the installation, and
verify the checksums with a PGP-2.6.3ia or PGP-2.6.3in compatible tool.

To the maximum extent of my knowledge, MirBSD is free for non-com-
mercial and commercial use as well as non-commercial redistributi-

nal arrangements, such as supplying the source code with redistri-
butions.  Some parts of the system are covered by different licen-
ces, such as the GNU GPL, LGPL, the ASF and Sendmail license.  You
are responsible by yourself to read and comply with these terms if
you intend redistribution. To the maximum extent of our knowledge,
MirOS is free from code that is intended to do damage or infringes
third parties' rights, although due to the implied error-proneness
and complexity of software, as well as the sheer size of the MirOS
operating environment and MirPorts framework, code can be mis-used
so usage of MirOS/MirPorts is at your own risk.


MirOS supplements

that directory, to find out about other strings attached with MirOS.

Some of the supplied software is covered by GNU licences. The source
