							MirOS#8 BSD/i386

Setup CD for MirOS/i386
=======================

This CD provides you with the standard MirOS GENERIC kernel as well as a
small ramdisk image. You can install or upgrade a MirOS installation and
do some basic repair tasks. Also included are some useful tools, for ex-
ample an ssh client and server facilitating remote control.

For further information on how to set up MirOS, please go to our website
at http://MirBSD.org/ and read the installation documents.


About MirOS BSD
===============

What is MirBSD?
---------------

MirBSD is not a project or stand-alone product but rather defined as the
contents of _my_ /usr/src and /usr/ports directories. I am Thorsten "mi-
rabile" Glaser, nice to meet you. I hope I can be of help to you, by ma-
king this project available to the general public.

What am I instaling then?
-------------------------

This is MirOS BSD, a community-developed successor of MirBSD®, developed
by a few individuals around the world (mostly Europe but also Canada and
the rest of America). MirOS is an open source work, although not yet OSI
certified open source software (a trademark of The Open Source Initiati-
ve) for formal reasons.

If this is a boot image for a MirOS development snapshot, just boot from
the CD and start hacking. Please be sure to report problems and consider
to send unified diffs for stuff you fixed.

If this is a formal release, the directory in which you are reading this
file also contains checksums of the installation sets (*ngz) and kernels
(bsd*). You can check them from within the installation. Check the vali-
dity of the signatures on the checksum with a PGP-2.6.3ia or PGP-2.6.3in
compatible tool.

To the maximum extent of my knowledge, MirBSD is free for non-com-

butions.  Some parts of the system are covered by different licen-
ces, such as the GNU GPL, LGPL, the ASF and Sendmail license.  You
are responsible by yourself to read and comply with these terms if
you intend redistribution. To the maximum extent of our knowledge,
MirOS is free from code that is intended to do damage or infringes
third parties' rights, although due to the implied error-proneness
and complexity of software, as well as the sheer size of the MirOS
operating environment and MirPorts framework, code can be mis-used
so usage of MirOS/MirPorts is at your own risk.
