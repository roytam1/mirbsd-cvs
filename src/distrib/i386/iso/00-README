About MirBSD
============

MirBSD is not a project, it is, by definition, the contents of _my_
/usr/src and /usr/ports directories. I am Thorsten "mirabile" Glaser,
nice to meet you. I hope to be able to help you by making this project
available to the general public.

This is MirOS BSD, a community-developed successor of MirBSD®, developed
by a few individuals around the world (mostly Europe, but also Canada
and the rest of America). MirOS is open source software, although not
OSI certified open source software (which is a trademark of The Open
Source Initiative).

If this is a boot image for a MirOS development snapshot, just boot
from the CD and start hacking. Please be sure to report problems, and
consider to send unified diffs for stuff you fixed.

If this is a formal release, the directory where you are reading this
file from also contains checksums of the installation sets (*.ngz) and
kernels (bsd*). You can check them from within the installation, and
verify the checksums with a PGP-2.6.3ia or PGP-2.6.3in compatible tool.

the GNU GPL, LGPL and the ASF, NPL or Sendmail license. You are
responsible by yourself to read and comply with these terms if you
intend redistribution. To the maximum extent of our knowledge, MirOS
is free from code that is intended to do damage, though due to the
implied error-prone-ness and complexity of software as well as the
sheer size of the MirOS operating environment and MirPorts framework,
code can be mis-used, so usage of MirOS/MirPorts is at your own risk.
