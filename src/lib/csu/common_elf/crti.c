 * Mark all objects having a PT_NOTE section identifying
 * ourselves as MirOS BSD executables / (shared) objects
 *
 * The MirOS Project uses the "MirOS "+string marker for
 * checking the validity of the executables - currently,
 * the strings "MirOS Linux" and "MirOS BSD" are checked
 * for by the kernel. Traditionally, the "MirBSD" can be
 * used as an alias for "MirOS BSD", but this may change
 * in the future.
 * The "desc" for type 1 (OS version note) currently has
 * to be set to zero. Its least significant byte is used
 * as a version indicator; if it should ever be != zero,
 * the most significant byte in the first doubleword (32
 * bit) must be set to -1 (0xFF) for endianness reasons.
 * The two middle bytes, and all following bytes, can be
 * used as the version specifies.
