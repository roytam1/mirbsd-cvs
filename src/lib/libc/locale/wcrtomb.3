.Sh NAME
.Nm optu16to8 ,
.Nm wcrtomb
.Nd converts a wide character to a multibyte character (restartable)
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <wchar.h>
.Ft size_t
.Fn optu16to8 "char *s" "wchar_t wc" "mbstate_t *ps"
.Ft size_t
.Fn wcrtomb "char *s" "wchar_t wc" "mbstate_t *ps"
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn wcrtomb
converts the wide character given by
.Fa wc
to the corresponding multibyte character, and stores it in the array
pointed to by
.Fa s
unless
.Fa s
is a null pointer.
This function will modify the first at most
.Dv MB_CUR_MAX
bytes of the array pointed by
.Fa s ,
if
.Fa ps
is an initial conversion state.
Contrary to and violating
.St -susv3 ,
this implementation can store more bytes in
.Fa s
if
.Fa ps
is not the initial conversion state.
Starting with
.Mx 10 ,
.Dv MB_CUR_MAX
has been adjusted to accomodate this fact, from the old value of
.Dq 3
to a new value of
.Dq 5
calculated by the formula
.Do Po old-MB_CUR_MAX * 2 Pc \- 1 Dc .
.Pp
The behaviour of
.Fn wcrtomb
is affected by the
.Dv LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.
.Pp
.Fn optu16to8
behaves similar to
.Fn wcrtomb ,
but always converts from OPTU\-16 to OPTU\-8 encoding,
independent of the current locale.
.Pp
These are the special cases:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It "wc == 0"
For state-dependent encodings,
.Fn wcrtomb
stores a null byte preceded by a special byte sequence (if any)
to return to an initial state to the array pointed by
.Fa s ,
and the state object pointed by
.Fa ps
also returned to a initial state.
.It "s == NULL"
.Fn wcrtomb
just places
.Fa ps
into a initial state.
It is equivalent to the following call:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
wcrtomb(buf, L'\\0', ps);
.Ed
.Pp
Here,
.Fa buf
is a dummy buffer.
In this case,
.Fa wc
is ignored.
.It "ps == NULL"
.Fn mbrtowc
uses its own internal state object to keep the conversion state,
instead of
.Fa ps
mentioned in this manual page.
.Pp
Calling any other functions in
.Em libc
never changes the internal states of
.Fn optu16to8
or
.Fn mbrtowc ,
which are initialised at startup time of the program.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn optu16to8
and
.Fn wcrtomb
return:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It "positive"
The number of bytes (including any shift sequences)
which are stored in the array.
.It "(size_t)\-1"
.Fa wc
is not a valid wide character.
In this case,
.Fn wcrtomb
also sets
.Va errno
to indicate error.

.Sh ERRORS
.Fn optu16to8
and
.Fn wcrtomb
may cause an error in the following cases:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
.Fa wc
is not a valid wide character.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa ps
points to an invalid or uninitialised mbstate_t object.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcrtomb
function conforms to
.St -isoC-amd1 .
.Pp
At present,
.Mx
is limited to the UCS BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane), thus
OPTU\-8 is limited to the common subset of CESU\-8 and UTF\-8.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm optu16to8
function first appeared in
.Mx 11 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Thorsten Glaser Aq tg@mirbsd.de
wrote the entire internationalisation implementation in
.Mx .
He is also the steward for the OPTU encoding.
.Sh CAVEATS
On a system whose wide character type is only 16 bits wide, as opposed
to 31 bits of ISO 10646, the OPTU encoder and decoder are permitted to
not de- and recompose any surrogates encountered and pass them through
as if they were regular wide characters with no special function.
Since
.Mx
is such a system, the reference implementation does not care about
UTF\-16 surrogates (U+D800 to U+DFFF) posing as OPTU\-16 characters at all;
a planes-aware Universal Coded Character Set-using application is
required to handle surrogates by itself.
For compatibility purposes,
.Nm
should always be assumed to not treat surrogates specially; applications
.Em must
ensure to not produce invalid surrogates unless limited to the BMP.
.Pp
.Fn optu16to8
.Em does ,
however, correctly reject the codepoints U+FFFE and U+FFFF as invalid.
