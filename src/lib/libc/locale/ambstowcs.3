.Nd convert between multibyte and wide strings, allocating space for the result
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #define _ALL_SOURCE
.In wchar.h
.Ft "wchar_t *"
.Fn ambsntowcs "const char *s" "size_t n"
.Ft "wchar_t *"
.Fn ambstowcs "const char *s"

.Ft "char *"
.Fn awcstombs "const wchar_t *s"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ambsntowcs
and
.Fn ambstowcs
functions convert the NUL-terminated multibyte
.Pq MirOS OPTU\-8 encoded
string
.Fa s
into a wide
.Pq MirOS OPTU\-16 encoded
string, requesting just enough storage via
.Xr calloc 3
from the system to store the result, including a terminating WNUL character.
The
.Fn awcsntombs
and
.Fn awcstombs
functions convert the WNUL-terminated wide
.Pq MirOS OPTU\-16 encoded
string
.Fa s
into a multibyte
.Pq MirOS OPTU\-8 encoded
string, requesting just enough storage via
.Xr malloc 3
from the system to store the result, including a terminating NUL byte.
The
.Fn ambsntowcs
and
.Fn awcsntombs
functions convert at most
.Fa n
characters; the
.Fn ambstowcs
and
.Fn awcstombs
functions convert the entire string.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn ambsntowcs
and
.Fn ambstowcs
return the newly allocated wide character string.
.Fn awcsntombs
and
.Fn awcstombs
return the newly allocated multibyte character string.
Failure to allocate enough memory will terminate the calling programme,
.Nm xmalloc
style, with errorlevel 1 and an appropriate error message.
Passing a
.Dv NULL
pointer results in undefined behaviour.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm ambsntowcs ,
.Nm ambstowcs ,
.Nm awcsntombs ,
and
.Nm awcstombs
functions are
.Mx BSD
extensions and first appeared in
.Mx 11 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Thorsten Glaser Aq tg@mirbsd.de
wrote the entire internationalisation implementation in
.Mx .
He is also the steward for the OPTU encoding.
