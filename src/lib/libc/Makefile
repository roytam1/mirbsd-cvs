# All library objects contain sccsid strings by default; they may be
# excluded as a space-saving measure.  To produce a library that does
# not contain these strings, delete -DLIBC_SCCS and -DSYSLIBC_SCCS
# from CFLAGS below.  To remove these strings from just the system call
# stubs, remove just -DSYSLIBC_SCCS from CFLAGS in Makefile.inc.
