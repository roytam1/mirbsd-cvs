.Nm png
.Nd Portable Network Graphics format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library contains functions dealing with files in the PNG format.
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file format for
the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images.
PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also
replace many common uses of TIFF.
Indexed-colour, grayscale, and truecolour images are supported,
plus an optional alpha channel.
Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits.
.Pp
PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such
as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a
progressive display option.
PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity checking and
fast, simple detection of common transmission errors.
Also, PNG can storegamma and chromaticity data for improved
colour matching on heterogeneous platforms.
