$MirOS: X11/README,v 1.6 2006/08/08 21:42:43 tg Exp $

This module contains the X-Window subsystem for the MirOS
operating system family. Currently, it is based upon a
modified XFree86® tree, with changes incorportated from
the OpenBSD project.

X11 is not part of MirOS, but contributed for easier use,
manageability and availability.


For a complete licencing overview of the X11 module, please
read the MirOS licence template first, which covers this
module as a collective-work copyright. Then refer to the file
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc/LICENSE which documents
all the licences, trademarks and advertising clauses imposed
by the use of Xfree86®. Finally, there are some additions
taken over from OpenBSD originally. All advertising clauses
and trademark attributions required are reproduced in the
file /usr/share/doc/legal/LICENCE-BSD for reference (compiled
from src/share/doc/legal/lbsd-adc.mdoc source code).
