$MirOS: X11/README,v 1.4 2005/03/19 15:28:26 tg Exp $

This module contains the X-Window subsystem for the MirOS
operating system family. Currently, it is based upon a
modified XFree86(tm) tree, with changes incorportated from
the OpenBSD project.

X11 is not part of MirOS, but contributed for easier use,
manageability and availability.


For a complete licencing overview of the X11 module, please
read the MirOS licence template first, which covers this
module as a collective-work copyright. Then refer to the file
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc/LICENSE which documents
all the licences, trademarks and advertising clauses imposed
by the use of Xfree86(tm). Finally, there are some additions
taken over from OpenBSD originally. All advertising clauses
and trademark attributions required are reproduced in the
file src/share/doc/legal/lbsd-adc.mdoc for reference.
