.SH DESCRIPTION
.B evilwm
is a minimalist window manager based on aewm, extended to feature
many keyboard controls, and otherwise altered to be more friendly.
.PP
In
.BR evilwm ,
the focus follows the mouse pointer, and focus if not lost is
you stray onto the root window.  The current window border is shaded
gold, with other windows left as a dark grey.
.PP
You can use the mouse to manipulate windows either by click/dragging
the 1 pixel border, or by holding down Alt and doing so anywhere in the
client window. The controls are:
.IP "Button 1"
Move window.
.IP "Button 2"
Resize window.
.IP "Button 3"
Lower window.
.PP
Most keyboard controls are used by holding down Control and Alt, then
pressing a key. Available functions are:
.IP Return
Spawn new terminal.
.IP Escape
Delete current window.
.IP Insert
Lower current window.
.IP "H, J, K, L"
Move window left, down, up or right (16 pixels).
.IP "Y, U, B, N"
Move window to top-left, top-right, bottom-left or
bottom-right of screen.
.IP "Q, W, E, R"
These have the same meaning as \fBHJKL\fR, but resize the window.
The \fBQ\fR and \fBR\fR keys decrease and increase, respectively,
the width of the window, while \fBW\fR and \fBE\fR increase or
decrease the height.
.PP
The amount the window is resized by can be given by the application
and defaults to one (1) pixel.
In addition, no window is ever resized to less than one (1) pixel
width or height by these keys.
.IP I
Show information about current window.
.IP \`
Exit evilwm gracefully.
.IP Equals
Maximise current window vertically (toggle).
.IP X
Maximise current window (toggle).
.PP
If compiled with virtual desktop support, these functions are also available:
.IP F
Fix or unfix current window.
.IP "1 - 8"
Switch virtual desktop.
.IP Left
Previous virtual desktop.
.IP Right
Next virtual desktop.
.PP
In addition to the above, Alt+Tab can be used to cycle through windows
on screen.
.PP
To make
.B evilwm
exit, you have to kill the process.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-display display"
specifies the X display to run on.
.IP "-term termprog"
specifies an alternative program to run when spawning a new terminal (defaults
to xterm, or x-terminal-emulator in Debian).
.IP "-fg foreground"
frame colour of currently active window.
.IP "-bg background"
frame colour of inactive windows.
.IP "-bw borderwidth"
width of window borders in pixels.
.IP "-snap num"
enable snap-to-border support.  num gives the proximity in pixels to snap to.
.IP "-V"
print version number.
.SH BUGS
The author's idea of friendly may differ to that of many other people.

re-added the "old move behaviour" for MirOS #8.

Some of the MirOS additions have been inspired by work
