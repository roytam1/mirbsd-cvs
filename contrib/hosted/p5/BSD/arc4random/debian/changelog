libbsd-arc4random-perl (1.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert into a Debian native package (which will be uploaded
    to CPAN after acceptance into Debian) for easier maintenance;
    remove the debian/watch file
  * Add VCS-CVS and VCS-Browser fields to debian/control
  * Allow Debian Maintainer uploads
  * New “upstream” version with improved support for non-Debian-relevant
    OSes, an improved testsuite, more documentation and comments
  * Fix version number (1.3 was supposed to be 1.30; CPAN does not
    document this particular issue)
  * Add a TODO file with plans for the next release
