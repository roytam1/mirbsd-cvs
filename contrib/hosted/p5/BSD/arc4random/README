BSD::arc4random version 1.01
============================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

Perl 5.004_63 required.

Makefile.PL tries to auto-detect existence of arc4random_pushb by
looking at the operating system used; see below if this fails:

If your system does not have arc4random_pushb(3), edit the DEFINE
line in Makefile.PL to define HAVE_ARC4RANDOM_PUSHB to 0 and make
sure at least arc4random_addrandom(3) exists. *HOWEVER* note that
then, entropy pushed into the system will end up in the process's
own pool instead of in the kernel. You can fix this by regularily
calling arc4random() or arc4random_bytes() and writing the output
to /dev/urandom or similar (after obtaining permissions) FROM THE
SAME PROCESS/SCRIPT (other ithread is okay) or, better, providing
at compile time an arc4random_pushb(3)* implementation collecting
entropy, sending it to a sensible place, e.g. a gathering daemon.

*) http://www.mirbsd.org/man3/arc4random

If your system's arc4random(3) function suite is not in libc, edit
the LIBS line in Makefile.PL to include the appropriate library,
e.g. -lbsd on Debian or -lcrypt on Interix, and possibly the INC
line to use the appropriate header, e.g. something like this for
Debian libbsd: '-include /usr/include/bsd/bsd.h'

NOTE: This version of BSD::arc4random comes with an experimental
implementation tested on Debian instead, since libbsd is not yet
ready to use. This is a kludge and will go away. It is only used
automatically on Debian GNU/HURD, GNU/kFreeBSD, GNU/Linux, and
Cygwin and Solaris.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires arc4random(3) and arc4random_addrandom(3) in
libc. There are configuration options in Makefile.PL, to change
for example, if a different library like libcrypt on Interix is
required to pull in these functions.
