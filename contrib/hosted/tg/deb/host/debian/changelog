mirhost (20110419) unstable; urgency=low

  * host can do Multi-Arch: foreign as requested by vorlon
  * Add Origin and Bugs headers
  * New upstream snapshot:
    - modernise includes, licence, etc.; drop advertising clause
    - simplify porting
    - raise buffer size to accommodate large AXFR queries (Closes: #477478)
  * Bump Policy, no changes required
  * Build on etch from now on, due to RC bugfix; works there fine
