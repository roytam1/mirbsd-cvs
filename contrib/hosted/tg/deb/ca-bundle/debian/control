Description: ca-certificates and -java replacement (WTF suite, from MirBSD)
 This WTF suite package uses the static MirBSD CA certificate bundle
 to replace both the Debian ca-certificates and ca-certificates-java
 packages public keystores for OpenSSL, GnuTLS, Java™/JKS, as well as
 Mozilla ckbi source builds. It will also replace KDE and J2RE/J2SDK
 keystore files.
 .
 Note that the ksslcalist format used by KDE 3 and KDE 4 is FUBAR BAD,
 as it uses the DN of a certificate as index/primary key into the cert
 database, not taking into account that different certs may have the
 DN, for instance when a CA has both RSA and DSA keys… therefore, many
 HTTPS sites *will* probably fail Konqueror’s validation.
