# * prerm "remove"
# * old-prerm "upgrade" $new_version
# * conflictors-prerm "remove" "in-favour" $package $new_version
# * deconfigureds-prerm "deconfigure" "in-favour"
#	$package_being_installed $pbi_version ["removing"
#	$conflicting_package $cp_version]
# The package and dependencies are at least Half-Installed; dependencies
# have previously been configured and not removed.
#
# * new-prerm "failed-upgrade" $old_version
# Called when 'old-prerm "upgrade"' fails; new package not unpacked, all
# other constraints the same as above.
