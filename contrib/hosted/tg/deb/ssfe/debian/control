Description: split-screen front end for dumb programs
 ssfe(1) is the Sirc Screen Front-End (or Split Screen Front-End),
 which runs a line-oriented program in the background and provides
 a full screen interface for it.  The bottom line of the screen is
 the input line which supports emacs-style command line editing; a
 status bar is shown above, and on top, the background program's
 output is shown in a scrolling area.
 .
 ssfe can be configured to change between raw/cooked/irc mode,
 redisplay the input, word-wrap the output, and supports a protocol,
 facilitating basic communication between ssfe and the programe.
