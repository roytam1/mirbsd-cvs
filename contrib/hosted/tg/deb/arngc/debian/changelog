arngc (20140704) wtf; urgency=low

  * add arngb-slrd.c example, transfer MirBSD<->MirBSD using SSH
  * do not use fd for stunnel4 to avoid zombies hanging around
  * modernise
  * conflict with rngd from The Distribution which cannot be named
    since they switched away from Debian’s codebase to upstream’s
    (which lacks required features)
  * force gzip compression
  * fix operation with stunnel 5.x (and up to 9.x if they keep compatible)
