# concatenate .key .cer + chain into 0440 root:_stunnel /etc/ssl/stunnel.pem
# choose a random port (here: 12345), configure packet filter to reject
# all to the chosen port except allowed IPs to prevent DoSing
#
# note: to enable the "back direction" you need a MirBSD version
# sufficiently new enough to have a device reading which returns
# arandom and writing which adds to the lopool (wrandom); if un-
# sure, stick with /dev/arandom for the -F argument to stunnel3.
