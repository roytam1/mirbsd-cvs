Description: programmable small perl irc client (UTF-8, TLS, IPv6 ready)
 sirc is an Internet Relay Chat programmable client written
 in perl and C. It has a main perl script that can be run in
 'dumb' mode, standalone, and a separate split-screen front
 end in C, called ssfe.
 ssfe actually comes quite handy, you can use it for example
 as front-end for netcat/telnet (MUDs) or bnbot (chatting).
 .
 It sends characters encoded by default in UTF-8 to the server
 and in ISO-8859-1 to the terminal, unless the locale(1) command
 or start-up environment variables determine UTF-8 mode (for
 non-dumb mode only). Control characters are stripped off.
 The client has also support for sending ISO-8859-1 on the wire
 and any character set supported by p5-Encode to the terminal.
 Overlong lines are split automatically to smaller chunks.
 .
 This IRC client supports IPv6: http://www.feyrer.de/IPv6/
 The RANDEX protocol originated in this client.
 .
 The new command ACCEPT from ratbox-ircd (Freeforge et al.) is
 supported as well as the CAPAB IDENTIFY-MSG from dancer-ircd
 (Freenode/OPN et al.) which is invoked automatically and shows
 messages from identified users with different hooks («»[[¬]]).
 .
 SSL is supported by prefixing the port number with an 's' letter.
