abseps – arc4random based secure EGD protocol server
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The abseps dæmon serves entropy from arandom(4) on a MirBSD system
over the network, using an SSL-tunneled EGD protocol. Writebacks
are sent to the kernel using wrandom(4). The dæmon drops privileges
after initialisation (i.e. socket binding and SSL key reading), as
it doesn’t need these for its normal operation. (It could be run
completely without superuser privileges.)

Potential ports to other operating systems would need to implement
both reader and writer interfaces to the kernel entropy pool, which
might involve using privsep instead of privdrop, and (on non-OpenBSD)
recreating the arc4random system. Example code can be found in the
MirOS CVS repository (src/kern/ contains some for arc4random, and
src/usr.sbin/ntpd has an example for privsep), but since the goal
of abseps was to get its primary job done as KISS and reliably as
possible while being scalable to several hundred clients, it hasn’t
been implemented here yet.

A consumer designed for use with rngd of Linux rng-tools has been
provided with absepu.

This is draft quality software, so don’t expect much.
