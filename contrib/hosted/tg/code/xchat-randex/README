Notes:

* arc4random.c is no longer part of the source code tarball, it was an
  accident, as it's developed independently. Retrieve it from:
  + https://www.mirbsd.org/MirOS/dist/hosted/other/arc4random.c
  Note that the file is versioned but uncompressed and thus not signed.
  Anonymous CVS is an option.

  This file is required at least on Win32 and some GNU platforms.
