# This script produces an "ed2k" type URI for a given existing file.
# It is by no means normative, but developed by reverse engineering.
#
# Structure of an "ed2k" type URI:
#  ed2k://|file|<filename>|<size>|<hash>|[/]
# where the trailing slash is optional, "filename" is posix, except
# that no pipe sign can occur, size in octets (decimal) and hash...
# well, that's the hard part below. It's hexadecimal lowercase.
