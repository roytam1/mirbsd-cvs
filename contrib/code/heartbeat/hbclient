# Sample implementation for the Heartbeat protocol, originally desi-
# gned by the SixXS IPv6 tunnel provider. MirOS hbServer is not sup-
# ported or endorsed by SixXS.
# This is the client part of the implementation.
#
# Overview:
# This script is intended to be both usable as standalone command as
# well as a DJB-style "/service/*/run" script for supervision by djb
# daemontools. Configuration is at the top of the script; first end-
# user specific configuration such as passwords or interfaces; after
# that, machine class configuration (such as adaptions for the OS).
#
# The script ought to be chmod'd 0500 so no password leakage occurs.
#
# Installation for the SixXS version of the script:
# Put this into /service/sixxs/run chmod 0500. Create a subdirectory
# log/main, chown it to the log user (for example _dnslog). Create a
# /service/sixxs/log/run script (chmod 0555) containing these lines:
#	#!/bin/sh
#	exec setuidgid _dnslog multilog t ./main
# Edit the configuration sections below and start the service.
#
# You need some configuration in /etc too:
# --- begin /etc/hostname.gif4589
# !/sbin/ifconfig \$if up
# !/sbin/route -n add -inet6 default fe80::%\$if -mtu 1280
# --- end /etc/hostname.gif4589
#
# --- snippet /etc/ppp/ip-up
# [...]
# ifconfig gif4589 down
# [...]
# pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf 2>&1	| logger -t pfctl-load
# pfctl -i $1 -F state 2>&1	| logger -t pfctl-flush
# pfctl -e >/dev/null 2>&1	# just in case...
# [...]
# /service/sixxs/run once 2>&1 | logger -t 'sixxs-reload'
# ifconfig gif4589 giftunnel $4 212.224.0.188 up
# [...]
# --- end /etc/ppp/ip-up
#
# You also need to configure the following line in /etc/pf.conf
# if you have a subnet:
#	rdr on $TUNNEL inet6 from any to $MYUSER -> 2001:x:y:z:a:b:c:d
# If not, add the following to /etc/hostname.gif4589:
#	!/sbin/ifconfig \$if inet6 ${MYUSER} ${MYUSER%2}1 prefixlen 128
#
# Invocation if not run via daemontools:
# hbclient &		- run as background process, beating
# hbclient down		- run once, tell the server the tunnel is down
# hbclient pass		- run once, ask server for password change
#			  (interactively asks for new password twice)
# hbclient once		- run once, beat once only
#
# Changing the password is only supported by the MirOS hbServer, not
# by SixXS.
