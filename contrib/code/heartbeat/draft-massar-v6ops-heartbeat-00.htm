<p>
When operating a IPv6 Tunnel Broker <a href="#RFC3053" title="Durand, A., Fasano, P., Guardini, I. and D. Lento, IPv6 Tunnel Broker, January 2001.">[RFC3053]</a>
with one or multiple Tunnel Servers <a href="#RFC3053" title="Durand, A., Fasano, P., Guardini, I. and D. Lento, IPv6 Tunnel Broker, January 2001.">[RFC3053]</a>
or any other form of tunneling across the Internet one doesn't
want to send packets out to unsuspecting endpoints.
Unsuspecting endpoints are hosts which don't expect traffic
from the Tunnel Server. This is a common scenario when a
non-static but configured endpoint is used.
The user enables  the tunnel to the current endpoint, uses it
and then disconnects from the Internet or gets another IP,
due to dhcp policies or various other reasons. Though the 
endpoint of the tunnel changes but there currently is no way
of automatically changing that endpoint or notifying the
Tunnel Server that it has changed. Current solutions include
using a script to update the endpoint on the Tunnel Broker's
website and various other non-standardized methods.

</p>
<p>
Then another host get to use the IP which terminates the tunnel
and suddenly it receives our tunneled packets. This could be
seen as a security risk as the new user of the IP could sniff
the packets and look at them or could even setup the tunnel
and take over connections which where active on that tunnel
impersonating the former host using the tunnel. Many hosts
employ so called firewall or logging facilities that will
start complaining about packets being sent from the
Tunnel Server which they perceive as malicious.

</p>
<p>
The user of this firewall will in turn start complaining about abuse
and hack attempts which takes up time from the staff running the
Tunnel Broker and not even mentioning all the entities that will be
notified by these type of messages.

</p>
<p>
This protocol resolves this problem by specifying a oneway heartbeat
protocol. As long as the tunnel endpoint is able to send an
authenticated heartbeat packet the tunnel is kept configured on the
side of the Tunnel Server allowing two-way traffic to be sent.
This heartbeat protocol also allows for automatic tunnel
reconfiguration so that in the event of an IP change at the client
side the tunnel will be reconfigured allowing continued service
without a (notable) interruption. If the Tunnel Server doesn't
receive a heartbeat for a certain amount of time it can deem the
endpoint as down and deconfigure the tunnel. Taking these two into
consideration will stop the sending of tunneled packets and will
thus avoid the complaints which could have been brought up before.

</p>
<p>
This protocol covers all tunneling protocols which use at least one
set of inner and one set of outer addresses. Note that some of these
protocols already have a heartbeat mechanism in the protocol.
In those cases it is of course advisable to use that mechanism.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;SixXS Heartbeat Protocol</h3>

<p>
The heartbeat packet is a UDP <a href="#RFC0768" title="Postel, J., User Datagram Protocol, August 1980.">[RFC0768]</a> packet to
IANA assigned port 3740 of the server to which the signalling is to take
place. Schematically this will look like the following diagram.

</p><pre>
+--------+                    +--------+
| Client | &lt;--- Internet ---&gt; | Server |
+--------+                    +--------+
</pre>

<p>
The heartbeat packet consists out of one single line separated
by spaces and ending in a NULL. The first part is the command
thus allowing extension of this protocol if wanted in the future.
Extensions are allowed to put additional commands on seperate
lines, currently those extensions are not defined but these
could be used for transmitting other informations like load
of the client which could be useful in failover scenario's.

</p>
<p>
The basic heartbeat packet looks like the following in ABNF <a href="#RFC2234" title="Crocker, D.H. and P. Overell, Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF, November 1997.">[RFC2234]</a>.
The IPv6address and IPv4address ABNF are defined in
"APPENDIX B: ABNF Description of Text Representations" of the
"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture" <a href="#RFC3513" title="Hinden, R. and S. Deering, Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture, April 2003.">[RFC3513]</a>.

</p><pre>
packet = command SP epochtime SP md5-signature NULL

command = *%x41-5A [*(SP option)]

option = *VCHAR

epochtime = *DIGIT

md5-signature = 32(HEXDIG)

NULL =  %x00
</pre>

<p>
epochtime is the time in seconds since "00:00:00 1970-01-01 UTC"
which corresponds to the output of to unix "date +%s" command.
Both the client and the server are advised to be synchronized
using NTP <a href="#RFC2030" title="Mills, D., Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI, October 1996.">[RFC2030]</a> to make sure that the system
clocks of the hosts don't differ to much even after travelling
the intermediate networks between the client and the server. 

</p>
<p>
The packet must be constructed first with the signature containing
the password for the tunnel. After construction the md5-signature
should be calculated and then replace the cleartext-password.
The packet can then be sent to the server.
This method thus allows verification of the password without
sending the password over the network. The Server does the same
thing, taking the command part of the packet, adding the password
and calculating the md5 signature which can then be compared with
the md5-signature which was sent by the client. If these match the
packet can be processed further. When the md5-signatures don't match
the server MUST silently ignore the packet.

</p>
<p>
Calculation of the MD5 signature <a href="#RFC1321" title="Rivest, R., The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm, April 1992.">[RFC1321]</a> MUST
be done over the complete string excluding the NULL which is the
string terminator in C and most other programming languages.
The scenarios section demonstrates how this is performed.

</p>
<p>
The currently defined commands HEARTBEAT and DISABLE both use the
following common options to identify the endpoint for which this
heartbeat is meant:

</p><pre>
common-options = ("HOST" endpoint | 
                  "TUNNEL" outer-endpoint SP inner-endpoint)

outer endpoint = endpoint | "sender"

inner endpoint = endpoint

endpoint = IPv4address | IPv6address
</pre>

<p>
An endpoint MAY also be a MAC address or other defined 'address'.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor4">3.1</a>&nbsp;Heartbeat Command</h4>

<p>
This command is the main reason for this protocol to exist.
It tells the Tunnel Server that the current endpoint specified
by both the UDP's source address and the common-option's outer
endpoint is still accepting tunneled packets.

</p>
<p>Specification:
</p><pre>
command = "HEARTBEAT" SP common-options
</pre>

<p>
</p>
<p>Example's:
</p>
<p>
Heartbeat from client host 192.0.2.2 :

</p><pre>
HEARTBEAT HOST 192.0.2.2 257209200
</pre>

<p>
Heartbeat from client host 192.0.2.2 for IPv6 tunnel endpoint 2001:db8::2 :

</p><pre>
HEARTBEAT TUNNEL 2001:db8::2 192.0.2.2 409100400
</pre>

<p>
In this example the server determines the inner-endpoint based
on the sender IP of the packet. This could be used in all cases
but is especially useful when the client is behind a NAT and
doesn't know it's external address. An application MUST not use
the 'sender' replacement when it knows it's public IP address.
This because it adds an extra verification step to the heartbeat.

</p><pre>
HEARTBEAT TUNNEL 2001:db8::2 sender 257209200
</pre>

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor5">3.2</a>&nbsp;Disable Command</h4>

<p>
The disable command explicitly sets a tunnel 'down' on the Tunnel Server
allowing a gracious and prompt shutdown of the tunnel on the Tunnel Server.
One could even employ this command to stop huge traffic flows to
the local endpoint which maybe could not cope with the traffic
passed over it through the tunnel.

</p>
<p>Specification:
</p><pre>
command = "DISABLE" SP common-options
</pre>

<p>Example:
</p>
<p>
Disable the tunnel endpoint 2001:db8::2 to 192.0.2.2 :

</p><pre>
DISABLE TUNNEL 192.0.2.2 2001:db8::2 409100400
</pre>

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>
The protocol presented has formed during the existence of
IPng <a href="#IPNG" title="van Pelt, P.B. and J.R. Massar, IPng - IPv6 Enduser Deployment, .">[IPNG]</a> and SixXS <a href="#SIXXS" title="Massar, J.R. and P.B. van Pelt, SixXS - IPv6 Deployment &amp; Tunnelbroker, .">[SIXXS]</a>
to allow the users of these tunnel broker systems to have
a dynamic non-static IPv4 endpoint.
This protocol is already in use by SixXS since October 2003
and has made a lot of users very happy and I would like to
thank the numerous users requesting the support for dynamic
non 24/7 reachable tunnel's.
This was before this protocol was implemented one of the few
requirements of obtaining a tunnel even when the project only
consisted of one Tunnel Server and was called IPng.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
The password used for creating the MD5 <a href="#RFC1321" title="Rivest, R., The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm, April 1992.">[RFC1321]</a>
signature should never be made publicly available to 3rd parties
otherwise that 3rd party could sign a packet and automatically
reconfigure the tunnel endpoint. This could lead into the 3rd
party sending traffic in both directions and thus posing as the actual user.

</p>
<p>
The inclusion of the timestamp along with the verification on the
Tunnel Server side should guard against any replay attacks.
The Tunnel Server MUST limit that the local clock compared to the
timestamp from the packet MUST never differ for more than 60 seconds,
this allows for at least some latency and time-desync.

</p>
<p>
Any packet that is not well formed or contains a invalid
signature MUST be silently dropped.

</p>
<p>
A side effect of this protocol is that whenever the local host
cannot send a heartbeat in time to the Tunnel Server that it will
deconfigure the tunnel. Envision a Denial of Service over the
tunnel to the local endpoint. The local host's heartbeat cannot
reach the Tunnel Server which in turn will automatically disable
the tunnel, allowing the host to catch some breath again and thus
effectively implementing a poor mans rate limiting.

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;Scenarios</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor9">6.1</a>&nbsp;Host heartbeat</h4>

<p>
This scenario handles the case where a host, the client using either
IPv6 or IPv4, sends notifications of it's aliveness to a server.
This could be used for server management and fallover situations.
In combination with extension commands, used on the additional
lines in the packet the client could send along information about
cpu load etc allowing the server to gather information about
those factors.

</p><pre>
+--------+                    +--------+
| Client | &lt;--- Internet ---&gt; | Server |
+--------+                    +--------+
</pre>
<pre>
Server's IPv6 : 2001:db8::1/64
Client's IPv6 : 2001:db8::2/64
Password      : point
</pre>

<p>
The command, including the password and epochtime would be:

</p><pre>
HEARTBEAT HOST 2001:db8::2 409100400 point
</pre>

<p>
The packet to be transmitted, after md5 translation is:

</p><pre>
HEARTBEAT HOST 2001:db8::2 409100400
                            bd72fb8d98b8698fa70cdfeb33bb7342
</pre>

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor10">6.2</a>&nbsp;IPv6 in IPv4 tunnel heartbeat</h4>

<p>
This scenario handles the case where a IPv6 in IPv4 tunnel
<a href="#RFC3056" title="Carpenter, B. and K. Moore, Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds, February 2001.">[RFC3056]</a> is setup between two hosts.
This is the normal case for a Tunnel Broker system with which a
IPv4 only host is given acces to a IPv6 network.
A tunnel like this can easily be setup using the Tunnel Setup 
Protocol <a href="#I-D.vg-ngtrans-tsp" title="Blanchet, M, Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP)A Control Protocol to Setup IPv6 or IPv4  Tunnels, July 2002.">[I-D.vg-ngtrans-tsp]</a>,
SixXS Configuration Service <a href="#SCS" title="Massar, J.R., SixXS Configuration Service, January 2004.">[SCS]</a> or similar
protocols. A diagram of such a setup:

</p><pre>
+--------+                               +--------+
| Client | &lt;--- IPv6 in IPv4 Tunnel ---&gt; | Server |
+--------+                               +--------+
</pre>
<pre>
Server's Outer IPv4 : 192.0.2.1
Server's Inner IPv6 : 2001:db8::1/64
Client's Outer IPv4 : 192.0.2.2
Client's Inner IPv6 : 2001:db8::2/64
Password            : hartslag
</pre>

<p>The command would be:
</p><pre>
HEARTBEAT TUNNEL 2001:db8::2 192.0.2.2 1051480800 hartslag
</pre>

<p>The data to be transmitted is:
</p><pre>
HEARTBEAT TUNNEL 2001:db8::2 192.0.2.2 1051480800
                                  3f0a026edb1b15e7c1a7a2d92b3c446a
</pre>

<p>Disabling the same tunnel can be accomplished using:
</p><pre>
DISABLE TUNNEL 2001:db8::2 192.0.2.2 1055628000 hartslag
</pre>

<p>The data to be transmitted is:
</p><pre>
DISABLE TUNNEL 2001:db8::2 192.0.2.2 1055628000
                                  53d5bb7bfe4a3a80da01227da02cda24
</pre>

<p>
The usage for which this protocol was defined in the first place
is signalling the server of the current IPv4 address of the client.
When the server receives a heartbeat packet it looks up the
configuration information based on the supplied Inner IPv6 address,
verifies that the password is correct by constructing the command
and generating the md5 signature. When the md5 signature is
incorrect the server MUST silently discard and ignore the packet.
A check MUST also be made comparing the Inner IPv4 address with
the IPv4 address from which the packet was sent, when incorrect
the server MUST discard and ignore the packet. Logs noting these
event MAY be made depending on the wishes of the administrator.
When the password is correct and thus the md5 verifies the server
will configure the IPv6 in IPv4 tunnel to point at the IPv4 address
specified by the Inner IPv4 parameter. When the Inner IPv4 parameter
is 'sender' the server MUST use the IPv4 address from which the
packet originates.

</p>
<p>
Note that TEST-NET <a href="#RFC3300" title="Reynolds, J., Braden, R., Ginoza, S. and A. De La Cruz, Internet Official Protocol Standards, November 2002.">[RFC3300]</a> addresses could never
reach a Tunnel Server over the public Internet due to filtering of
this documentation prefix.
