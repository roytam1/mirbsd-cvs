Notes for the heartbeat support
-------------------------------

The basics have been described in the draft by Jeroen Massar.
For the MirOS heartbeat implementation, the draft is extended
by the following comments:

1) From the draft command set, only the "HEARTBEAT TUNNEL" (and
   "DISABLE TUNNEL") commands are recognised. Unknown commands
   and the "HEARTBEAT HOST" command are silently discarded.

2) Instead of the outer-endpoint specifying the IPv6 address of
   the client, it is thought as the user ID, which is looked up
   in the database. Commands with unknown user IDs are silently
   discarded.
   The user id MUST be the third word in the command (ie. after
   the command and subcommand tokens) - this is a cause for not
   supporting "HEARTBEAT HOST".

3) Not receiving a valid "HEARTBEAT" command for 202 or more
   seconds is handled the same as receiving a "DISABLE" command.
   This is handled by the script called. (202 = 180 + utc-tai)

4) An additional command, "PASSWD <newpassword> <user>", is
   supported for automated password changes. The heartbeat server
   correctly updates the configuration file as well.

5) On each "HEARTBEAT" command, a command string is written into
   the pipe to the background script, one of these:
   - DOWN<nl>
   - IDLE<nl>
   - INIT<sp>username<sp>password<nl>
   - IP<x>.<x>.<x>.<x><nl>
   - PASS<sp>newpassword<nl>
   - QUIT<nl>

   INIT is issued only once, at startup. QUIT is issued only once
   as well, and should terminate the script cleanly. DOWN and IP
   are called on status changed, while IDLE is called if the status
   has not been changed (usually only in the UP state). PASS is
   called when the MirOS password change extension is used.

6) The time deviation can be as much as 82 (60 + utc-tai) seconds
   right now. Both 82 and 202 must be adapted if another leap
   second occurs in the future.

7) network I/O is done in a co-routine running concorrently, so
   the worries about packets going lost have been reduced.

8) draft-massar-v6ops-heartbeat-00.htm contains an error in the
   sample for the DISABLE command. Instead of
	DISABLE TUNNEL 192.0.2.2 2001:db8::2 409100400
   the correct order is
	DISABLE TUNNEL 2001:db8::2 192.0.2.2 409100400
   so that the username is the third token again.
