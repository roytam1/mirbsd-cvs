# Sample implementation for the Heartbeat protocol, originally desi-
# gned by the SixXS IPv6 tunnel provider. MirOS hbServer is not sup-
# ported or endorsed by SixXS but has proven inter-operable.
# This is a multi-server client implementation.
#
# Overview:
# This script is intended to be both usable as standalone command as
# well as a DJB-style "/service/*/run" script for supervision by djb
# daemontools. Configuration is at the top of the script; first end-
# user specific configuration such as passwords or interfaces; after
# that, machine class configuration (such as adaptions for the OS).
#
# The script ought to be chmod'd 0500 so no password leakage occurs.
#
# Installation instructions:
# Put this into /service/hbeat/run chmod 0500. Create a subdirectory
# log/main, chown it to the log user (for example _dnslog). Create a
# /service/hbeat/log/run script (chmod 0555) containing these lines:
#	#!/bin/sh
#	exec setuidgid _dnslog multilog t ./main
# Edit the configuration sections below and start the service.
#
# Invocation if not run via daemontools:
# hbmulti &		- run in the background, beating regularly
# hbmulti down		- run once, tell the server the host is down
# hbmulti once		- run once, beat once only
#
# Configuration information is kept in a set of arrays:
# cf_type		- the type ([def]ipv6:gif0 or simple)
# cf_user		- the username (or ipv6 address)
# cf_pass		- the password
# cf_host		- the remote server (and ipv6 tunnel server)
#
# For IPv6, only unnumbered tunnels are supported (configure the IPs
# after the script has started if needed). The "SENDER" extension is
# not available in this version of the script, nor does it support a
# password change operation (MirOS hbServer only).
#
# Available cf_type values:
# "ipv6:"interface	- do an IPv6 tunnel for <interface> but nei-
#			  ther configure an IP nor any route
# "defipv6:"interface	- do an IPv6 tunnel and a default route, but
#			  no IP address ("unnumbered tunnel")
# "simple"		- just beat, don't do anything locally
