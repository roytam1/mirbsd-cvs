Hello all!

I'm using the X Windowing System primarily as an xterm
multiplexer, so I get eight virtual consol^Wworkspaces
with one "work" xterm on each, plus logs and top(1).

Also in this directory: my new ~/.Xmodmap file for US-
English keyboards or sysadmins. The good part of it is,
that the key labelled < > | on my keyboard is used as
mode switch, so I can easily enter umlauts etc. without
the need of a weird Meta combination. The bad part is,
you'll need a keyboard with winkeys and the < > | key.

The port x11/terminus-font is designed to help hackers
in long nights; I installed it. If you do not like it,
just don't install the port, and you'll have to choose
between the standard (or vga) fonts.

As window manager I prefer evilwm, keyboard-usable toy,
due to its simplicity and usability. This is my sample
~/.xinitrc which is used to launch evilwm and two win-
dows designed to be sticky:

(see file dot.xinitrc in this directory)
The file ~/.etc/bin/xtm referred in said file is this one:

#!/bin/sh -
# $MirOS$
if [ x"$1" = x"vga" ]; then
	# exec xtm vga ...
	shift
	/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -class VXTerm "$@" &
	exit 0
  elif [ -e /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/terminus ]; then
	if [ x"$1" = x"big" ]; then
		# exec xtm big ...
		shift
		/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -class TXTerm -geom 101x33+0+0 \
		    -fn -xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal--20-200-72-72-c-100-iso8859-1 \
		    "$@" &
		exit 0
	  else
		exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -class TXTerm -geom 127x41+0+0 \
		    -fn -xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-80-iso8859-1 \
		    "$@"
	fi
  else
	exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -geom 113x42+0+0 -fn 9x15 "$@"
fi

When I want to have two windows open the same time, e.g.
for chatting, I use ~/.etc/bin/xchat for it:

---- cutting here may damage your screen surface -----
#!/bin/sh -
if [ -e /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/terminus ]; then
	/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -T irc-quakenet -si -geom 127x11+0+0 \
	    -fn -xos4-terminus-bold-r-normal--14-140-72-72-c-80-iso8859-1 \
	    -class TXTerm -e tinyirc mirabile irc.quakenet.org &
	/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -T irc-opn -si -geom 127x31+0+159 \
	    -fn -xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-80-iso8859-1 \
	    -class TXTerm -e sirc -i "MirBSD packages a kernel, userland and da attitude" &
  else
	/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -T irc-quakenet -si -geom 144x11+0+0 -fn 7x13 \
	    -e tinyirc mirabile irc.quakenet.org &
	/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -T irc-opn -si -geom 113x32+0+146 -fn 9x15 \
	    -e sirc -i "MirBSD packages a kernel, userland and da attitude" &
fi
exit 0

Netscape can use the mouse wheel as well: ~/.Xresources
(the file is saved as dot.Xresources in this directory)
