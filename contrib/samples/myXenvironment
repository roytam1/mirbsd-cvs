Hello all!

I'm using the X Windowing System primarily as an xterm
multiplexer, so I get eight virtual consol^Wworkspaces
with one "work" xterm on each, plus logs and top(1).

Also in this directory: my new ~/.Xmodmap file for US-
English keyboards or sysadmins. The good part of it is,
that the key labelled < > | on my keyboard is used as
mode switch, so I can easily enter umlauts etc. even in
non-behaving X11 applications. (It's dot.Xmodmap.xapps,
the other two are older examples.) The bad part is, you
need a keyboard with winkeys and the < > | key. (Though
that's not entirely needed.) Note that every self-re-
specting computer user wants US-like layout.

The port x11/terminus-font is designed to help hackers
in long nights; I installed it. If you do not like it,
just don't install the port, and you'll have to choose
between the standard (or vga) fonts. fixed-misc is the
standard uxterm font and contains much more characters.

As window manager I prefer evilwm, keyboard-usable toy,
due to its simplicity and usability. This is my sample
~/.xinitrc which is used to launch evilwm and two win-
dows designed to be sticky:

(see file dot.xinitrc in this directory)
The file ~/.etc/bin/xtm referred in said file is this one:

When I want to have two windows open the same time, e.g.
for chatting, I used ~/.etc/bin/xchat for it (see below)
but recently I'm just invoking GNU screen (and have also
changed IRC networks).

Netscape can use the mouse wheel as well: ~/.Xresources
(the file is saved as dot.Xresources in this directory)
