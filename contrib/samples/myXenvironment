Hello all!

I'm using the X Windowing System primarily as an xterm
multiplexer, so I get eight virtual consol^Wworkspaces
with one "work" xterm on each, plus logs and top(1).

Also in this directory: my new ~/.Xmodmap file for US-
English keyboards or sysadmins. The good part of it is,
that the key labelled < > | on my keyboard is used as
mode switch, so I can easily enter umlauts etc. without
the need of a weird Meta combination. The bad part is,
you'll need a keyboard with winkeys and the < > | key.

The port x11/terminus-font is designed to help hackers
in long nights; I installed it. If you do not like it,
just don't install the port, and you'll have to choose
between the standard (or vga) fonts.

As window manager I prefer evilwm, keyboard-usable toy,
due to its simplicity and usability. This is my sample
~/.xinitrc which is used to launch evilwm and two win-
dows designed to be sticky:

(see file dot.xinitrc in this directory)
The file ~/.etc/bin/xtm referred in said file is this one:

When I want to have two windows open the same time, e.g.
for chatting, I use ~/.etc/bin/xchat for it:

---- cutting here may damage your screen surface -----
#!/bin/sh
if [ -e /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/terminus ]; then
	/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -T irc-quakenet -si -geom 127x11+0+0 \
	    -fn -xos4-terminus-bold-r-normal--14-140-72-72-c-80-iso8859-1 \

Netscape can use the mouse wheel as well: ~/.Xresources
(the file is saved as dot.Xresources in this directory)
