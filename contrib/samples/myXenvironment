Hello all!

For some future directions, see near the end of file.

[ Update 2011-10-15: Some of this is no longer true;
I’m still using the .Xmodmap on BSD and GNU-at-work,
the latter in the “gnu” CVS branch, and the .xinitrc
at home. At work I also use the .Xresources file from
here – currently transitioning to a newer xterm than
MirBSD’s 200 or hardy’s 229 to get rid of cut buffers
and become able to use an underlined cursor – but on
BSD I’ve switched to the much easier one from base –
src/etc/skel/dot.Xresources,v – and just UXTerm. As
font I use fixed-misc 9x18+18x18ko exclusively now. ]

I'm using the X Windowing System primarily as an xterm
multiplexer, so I get eight virtual consol^Wworkspaces
with one "work" xterm on each, plus logs and top(1).

Also in this directory: my new ~/.Xmodmap file for US-
English keyboards or sysadmins. The good part of it is,
that the key labelled < > | on my keyboard is used as
mode switch, so I can easily enter umlauts etc. even in
non-behaving X11 applications. (It's dot.Xmodmap.xapps,
the other two are older examples.) The bad part is, you
need a keyboard with winkeys and the < > | key. (Though
that's not entirely needed.) Note that every self-re-
specting computer user wants US-like layout.

The port x11/terminus-font is designed to help hackers
in long nights; I installed it. If you do not like it,
just don't install the port, and you'll have to choose
between the standard (or vga) fonts. fixed-misc is the
standard uxterm font and contains much more characters.

Not all applications are unicode ready yet, especially
centericq. Consider this experimental.

As window manager I prefer evilwm, keyboard-usable toy,
due to its simplicity and usability. This is my sample
~/.xinitrc which is used to launch evilwm and two win-
dows designed to be sticky: (see file dot.xinitrc in
this directory)

The file ~/.etc/bin/xtm referred in said file is this one:

I however recommend everyone who does not like evilwm to
use IceWM, it's about the best choice one can make.

When I want to have two windows open the same time, e.g.
for chatting, I used ~/.etc/bin/xchat for it (see below)
but recently I'm just invoking GNU screen (and have also
changed IRC networks).

Netscape can use the mouse wheel as well: ~/.Xresources
(the file is saved as dot.Xresources in this directory)

[ Update 2011-10-15: My IBM X40 doesn’t have a mouse or
wheel, so… besides, I use GNU screen inside most xterms
which has different scrolling mechanisms, and I don’t
push back into the xterm scroll buffer; copy-paste also
is easier that way. ]


Possible future directions:

I'll put the default window placement and stuff into my
~/.Xresources and will call evilwm with -term uxterm and
fully switch to UTF-8 (possibly affecting the xterm call
in ~/.xinitrc as well). Might ditch Terminus, especially
for the rare occasion I need some larger font.

centericq in MirPorts has become UTF-8 capable, as has
almost the entire MirOS base system. (With quirks, of
course, because e.g. tabulating programmes - column,
ls, pr, ... - don't use mbwidth() and friends.) As soon
as our text console (wscons) has switched to UTF-8, we
will go the Plan 9 way and only allow UTF-8 or ASCII.
Legacy programmes that require ISO-8859-1 support can
be run in GNU screen (from MirPorts) quite fine, as can
ssh sessions to non-unicode operating systems. I figure
this is fairly ok. Something like 'wsconfig -U' must be
used for ssh though, because the remote side often does
not allow environment passing. (GNU has such a tool,
called vt-is-UTF8, but it doesn't work on ptys. Idiots.)
