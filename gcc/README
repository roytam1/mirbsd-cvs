$MirOS$

This is the GCC module as contributed along with the
MirOS operating system (see http://mirbsd.de/ for this
one), part of the GNU project - http://gcc.gnu.org/

All material in this module is either copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation or contributed to them (boehm-gc,
mostly). MirOS committers are suggested to assign back the
copyright (not the European moral rights) to the FSF, and
thus, this module only contains additional code which is
copyrighted by the OpenBSD people including Hiroaki Etoh;
most of them have already or are working on getting the
copyright assigned back to the FSF.

There is no additional collective copyright asserted for
this module, and it is not part of MirOS.

The code in here is mostly licenced under the GNU GPL,
Version 2 or later, some with the library exception
clause. Some of the code is licenced under the GNU LGPL.
Rarely it's a BSD/MIT/X11-style licence (boehm-gc, mostly).

Most documentation in here is licenced under the GNU FDL.
While the MirOS Project asserts there are some problems with
the GFDL and recommends against its use, since the copyright
for the changes by the MirOS Project members are with the
FSF, there is nothing we can do about this. However, we chose
to redistribute this documentation along with gcc itself for
practical reasons.

In any case, you can retrieve the original and current
modified versions of the documentation from the MirOS CVSweb,
and the original versions from the GCC CVSweb.
The MirOS CVSweb can be found on the MirOS Project's homepage,
for example at http://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de/cvs.cgi/gcc/

GNU and MirOS licences can be found in /usr/share/doc/legal/
after installation.
