Linking with independent modules may be not covered by the GNU GPL,
but inheriting a class from libgcj seems to be. The key term seems
to be "independent module"; the FSF does not want to clarify if a
class which is derived from a libgcj class (such as Applet) may be
considered no derived work from libgcj, or in which cases. We thusly
urge people to not use gcj with libgcj for developing their programmes.
