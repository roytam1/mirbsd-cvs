README for the MirOS CVS Repository administrative files

• We use $MirOS $ as the only keyword, all others, like $Id $ are disabled

• All texts are in UTF-8 (or should be)… well, actually CESU-8, but that
  doesn’t matter as we stay in the BMP. Or plain ISO_646.irv:1991 (ASCII).

• CVSweb is at
  ‣ http://cvs.mirbsd.de/CVSROOT/		(AllBSD Japan)
  ‣ https://www.mirbsd.org/cvs.cgi/CVSROOT/	(MirOS Germany)

• We use a patched CVS version, cf. mircvs://ports/devel/cvs/patches/
  You need, in *all* cases, GNU CVS 1.12.x (x ≥ 12 has been tested)!
  Make sure CVSROOT/config has UseNewInfoFmtStrings=yes set as well!
  GNU CVS 1.12.14 might cause problems.

• The patched CVS version exposes the new ‘%I’ specifier to the loginfo
  et al. scripts containing the commit ID; if you want to use our scripts
  either patch your CVS (highly recommended) or replace them with ‘-’ (a
  single dash) to use the process group (needs mksh R34+ or Perl)

• You will need mksh: http://mirbsd.de/mksh

• Some other programmes required are ed, expand/unexpand, hostname, some
  sendmail-like tool (if sending mails), cvs itself (e.g. for diffs),
  (non-GNU) sed, date, a standard-conforming ls (might be replaced by
  use of stat soon), readlink (soon using mksh realpath builtin)

• $ mkdir $CVSROOT/.tmp; chmod 1775 $CVSROOT/.tmp

• $ mkdir $CVSROOT/Logs; chmod 775 $CVSROOT/Logs
  $ touch $CVSROOT/Logs/ChangeLog; chmod 664 $CVSROOT/Logs/ChangeLog
  (either that or change the -f argument to $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/ChangeLog
  for the OpenBSD-style layout)

• you must cvs add all files in a checkout of the CVSROOT module first,
  but make sure they have 0775 permissions and are listed in the file
  checkoutlist, as they are here in our repository

• Sample use for no mails (2nd one with diffs):
  ALL	$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/mklogci - -f $CVSROOT/Logs/ChangeLog -C %r -p %p %{sVv}
  ALL	$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/mklogci - -Df $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/ChangeLog -C %r -p %p %{sVv}

• Make sure all files (especially genlog and tracker) are committed, listed
  in checkoutlist AND show up at “ls -l $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/” on the server,
  *before* editing commitinfo, loginfo, etc.

• If you still get the permissions in the repo wrong, look at cvs-genperm

• The $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/.#* files are temporaries and can be deleted once
  everything is working; they get generated on updating checkoutlist files

• Contact us at ＜miros-discuss＠mirbsd.{de,org}＞ for further information
  or join IRC at 「#MirBSD」 on the 「irc.ipv6.freenode.net:6667」 network
  (port 6697 to use SSL)
